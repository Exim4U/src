3) Email Admin (php web interface login) - Customize Header Text

The Exim4U Email Admin web pages are located here:

	home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u

The header text, "Exim4U Email Admin", in the upper left hand portion of the web page may be displayed
in three ways:

	a) As a link (bold blue) to the Exim4U home page, http://exim4u.org,
	   which is the default setting.
	b) As a link (bold blue) to the current page (_self).
	c) As plain bold dark grey text without any link.

The files that determine the way that the "Exim4U Email Admin" header text is displayed are contained
in this directory:

	home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config

The files that contain the php code for displaying the header text are:
 
	header_domain.php
	header.php

The following files may be copied to header_domain.php and header.php to produce the desired header text
appearance:

	header_domain.php-BOLD
	header_domain.php-LINK_EXIM4U
	header_domain.php-LINK_SELF
	header.php-BOLD
	header.php-LINK_EXIM4U
	header.php-LINK_SELF

Therefore;

	a) To have the header text appear as a link to the current page (_self) then perform the
	   following from this distribution's root directory:

		cd home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config
		cp header_domain.php-LINK_SELF header_domain.php
		cp header.php-LINK_SELF header.php

	b) To have the header text appear as plain bold dark grey text (_self) then perform the 
	   following from this distribution's root directory:

	        cd home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config

        	cp header.php-BOLD header.php

	c) To have the header text appear as a link to the Exim4U home page, http://exim4u.org,
	   (default configuration) then perform the following from this distribution's root
	   directory:

        	cd home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config
        	cp header_domain.php-LINK_EXIM4U header_domain.php
        	cp header.php-LINK_EXIM4U header.php


4) Email Admin (php web interface login) - Customize Logo

All of the logos and images used by the Exim4u Email Admin web pages are stored in the 
following directory:

	home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images

The logo that appears below the login credentials in the web page is named:

	logo.gif

You may substitute your own logo or image as per your preferences by replacing the logo.gif file
with a .gif version of your logo.  You should re-size your image to the same dimensions as the
logo.gif file which is 88px X 52px in order to ensure the proper placement of the image on the
web page. The Exim4U logo is also provided in the file exim4u.gif.

You may remove the logo altogether from the web page by replacing the logo.gif file with
the following clearpixel.gif file:

        home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images/clearpixel.gif

Therefore, to remove the logo altogether, from this distribution's root directory copy the
clearpixel.gif file to logo.gif as follows:

        cd home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images
        cp clearpixel.gif logo.gif


5) Email Admin (php web interface internal pages) - Customize Check Mark Image

The Exim4U Email Admin web interface utilizes a check mark image on several pages.  The most prominent
use of this image is in the "Add, delete and manage POP/IMAP accounts" page. The image that is used
for the check mark is stored in the following directory:

 home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images

The check mark is named:

       check.gif

You may select which image is to be used as the check mark image from the following image files:

	check-exim4u.gif - Default Exim4U Image
	check-vexim.gif  - Default Vexim Image
	human-exim4u.gif - Human Image

Therefore, to change the image, simply copy the selected file to check.gif.

To use human-exim4u.gif as the check mark:

	cd home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images
        cp human-exim4u.gif check.gif

To use check-vexim.gif as the check mark:

	cd home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images
        cp check-vexim.gif check.gif

To use check-exim4u.gif as the check mark:

	cd home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images
        cp check-exim4u.gif check.gif


6) Webmail (Horde) - Customize Theme, Images And Logos

Exim4U's webmail uses the Horde Silver Surfer theme. You may substitute your preferred Horde theme
in the file:

	home/exim4u/public_html/webmail/config/prefs.php

The theme section appears in the prefs.php file as follows:

	// UI theme 
	$_prefs['theme'] = array( 
	    'value' => 'silver',  
	    'locked' => false, 
	    'shared' => true, 
	    'type' => 'select', 
	    'desc' => _("Select your color scheme.")

Search the prefs.php file for "UI theme" and modify the 'value' parameter to specify your preferred
theme.

You may replace or remove the logo below the login credentials on the Webmail Groupware login page.
The login page logo is located here:

	home/exim4u/public_html/webmail/themes/silver/graphics/horde-power1.png

To change this logo, simply replace horde-power1.png with your preferred logo file by copying your
preferred logo file to horde-power1.png. Please note that your logo should be converted to a .png file.
Alternatively, to remove this logo altogether, replace the horde-power1.png file with:

	home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images/clearpixel.png

To replace the logo on the top of the sidebar with your logo (Traditional Mode only), login to Webmail's
Traditional Mode as Administrator and go to:

	Administration > Setup > Webmail Groupware (horde) > Menu

Then, place the url for your preferred logo in the next to last field which is $conf[logo]. You can
also specify a link for the logo in the last field which is $conf[logo][link]. 

The small favicon size icon that is found in various places in both the Traditional and Dynamic mode is
located here: 

	/home/exim4u/public_html/webmail/themes/silver/graphics/horde.png

To change this icon simply replace horde.png with your preferred logo file by copying your
preferred logo file to horde.png. Please note that your logo should be converted to a .png file.
Alternatively, to remove this icon altogether, replace the horde.png file with:

        home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images/clearpixel.png
