The Admin Menu web page is located here:

You may substitute your own logo or image as per your preferences by replacing the logo.gif file

The Exim4U Email Admin web interface utilizes a check mark image on several pages.  The most prominent
use of this image is in the "Add, delete and manage POP/IMAP accounts" page. The image that is used
for the check mark is stored in the following directory:

 home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images

The check mark is named:

       check.gif

You may select which image is to be used as the check mark image from the following image files:

	check-exim4u.gif - Default Exim4U Image
	check-vexim.gif  - Default Vexim Image
	human-exim4u.gif - Human Image

Therefore, to change the image, simply copy the selected file to check.gif.

To use human-exim4u.gif as the check mark:

	cd home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images
        cp human-exim4u.gif check.gif

To use check-vexim.gif as the check mark:
