                   Bootstrappified Exim4U
              Alternative Exim4U User Interface

This exim4u_bs directory includes all of the stock Exim4U php code with 
a modified Exim4U user interface which is implemented using a stock
Bootstrap* 2.2.2 .css. Refer to the following:

All files in this directory should be copied to the exim4u directory in
your document root such as /home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u. The files
should be readable by apache but not writeable by apache.

From within this directory execute:
        cp -r * <target document root directory>/exim4u
        chown -R <directory owner>.apache <target document root directory>/exim4u
        chmod -R 755 <target document root directory>/exim4u
Example:
        cp -r * /home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u
        chown -R exim4u.apache /home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u
        chmod -R 755 /home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u

The siteadmin password is stored in /exim4u/config/variables.php which
should be set so that the owner has read/write access, the group has read access
and all other users have no access:
        chmod 750 <target document root directory>/exim4u/config/variables.php
Example: 
        chmod 750  /home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config/variables.php
