- Drop down list to select from local users or calendars in the attendees view.

- The option to not have any personal calendars displayed, now with remote
  calendars this would be a desirable option.

- Remove the assumption that each calendar is using the same backend. Ideally
  it should be possible to have a local calendar using sql or kolab and a
  remote calendar using another driver (eg wcap or whatever mozilla uses).

- Drivers should handle the permissions checks instead of accessing shares
  directly (outside drivers) to get the permissions for an event or calendar.
  One day we might have a calendar backend that knows about permissions.

- Allow publishing calendars to a remote site as iCalendar files.

- Saving of individual events as .ics files.

- Support for searching a local file system for freebusy info.

- Support for searching freebusy.office.microsoft.com for freebusy info.

- Automatically locate a meeting time.

- Add a quick tool for planning meeting agendas.

- Handle resource scheduling/management somehow, either per-calendar or by
  kinds of calendars, including rules for when overlapping appointments are
  allowed, etc.

- lib/Driver/ical.php should be the central location for remote calendar
  support. Needs to be finished.

- RSS or Atom feed for upcoming events.

- Natural language quick event creation? (ex: 3/26 2am Raid on
  Ironforge [WoW] +thrall +gromhellscream)
