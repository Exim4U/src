The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H3 (2.3.2).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application.  It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server.  Supported features include shared
calendars, remote calendars, meeting management, alarms, recurring events, and
a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping
events.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H3 (2.3.1) are:
    * Improved synchronization support.
    * Allow to add address lists as attendees through the address book popup.
    * Fixed several issues with all-day events.
    * Many minor bug fixes.
