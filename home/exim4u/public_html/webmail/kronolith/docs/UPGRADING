These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Kronolith versions. Please
backup your existing data before running any of the steps described below. You
can't use the updated data with your old Kronolith version anymore.


Upgrading Kronolith from 2.3 to 2.3.x
=====================================

If you want to use the holidays feature, at least version 0.21.0 of
Date_Holidays is required now.


Upgrading Kronolith from 2.2 to 2.3.x
=====================================

Some fields in the SQL share driver tables have been changed. Execute the
provided SQL script to update your database if you are using the native SQL
share driver.

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password>  <db name> < scripts/upgrades/2.2_to_2.3.sql


Upgrading Kronolith from 2.1.x to 2.2.x
=======================================


SQL Backends
------------

Two new fields have been added to the default SQL table layout.

Execute the provided SQL script to update your data to the new Kronolith
version, e.g.::

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password> <db name> < scripts/upgrades/2.1_to_2.2.sql


New Beta SQL Share Driver Support
---------------------------------

A new beta-level SQL Horde_Share driver has been added in Horde 3.2. This driver
offers significant performance improvements over the existing Datatree driver,
but it has not received the same level of testing, thus the beta designation.
In order to make use of this driver, you must be using Horde 3.2-RC3 or
later. The new tables needed for this driver already should have been created
by the step above.

If you want to use the new SQL Share driver, you must also execute the
provided PHP script to migrate your existing share data to the new format::

   php scripts/upgrades/convert_datatree_shares_to_sql.php

Upgrading Kronolith from 2.3 to 2.3.1
=====================================

Kronolith requires at least version 0.21.0 of Date_Holidays now, which has
much better support for translations.


Preferences
-----------

The preference that stores the address books that are searched for attendees
with free/busy urls has changed both the name and the format. The preference
used to be called "search_abook" and contained a serialized PHP array. The new
preference is called "search_sources", contains a tab-separated list, and goes
along with the "search_fields" preference.


Upgrading Kronolith from 1.1.x to 2.0.x
=======================================


SQL Backends
------------

Three new fields and a new table have been added to the default SQL table
layout to provide the scheduling features to Kronolith.

Execute the provided SQL script to update your data to the new Kronolith
version::

   mysql --user=root --password=<MySQL-root-password> <db name> < scripts/upgrades/1.1_to_2.0.mysql.sql


Categories
----------

Categories are now being maintained centrally for all Horde applications that
support them.  To convert the old event categories execute the provided PHP
script::

   php scripts/upgrades/2004-05-19_convert_categories_to_strings.php
