These are instructions to upgrade from earlier MIMP versions.


Upgrading MIMP From 1.0.x To 1.1.x
==================================

This is a non-exhaustive, quick explanation of what has changed between an
MIMP 1.0.x installation to MIMP 1.1.x.


IMP Dependency
--------------

MIMP now runs on top of IMP.  Therefore, you will need to set-up the Horde
Framework version 3.2+ and IMP version 4.2+ before you can install MIMP.
