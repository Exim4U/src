This document contains instructions for installing the MIMP web-based mail
client on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of MIMP, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the MIMP distribution.


Obtaining MIMP
===============

MIMP can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/mimp/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/mimp/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of MIMP are available via CVS; see the
file `docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution, or the website
http://www.horde.org/source/, for information on accessing the Horde CVS
repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, MIMP **REQUIRES** the following:

1. A working IMP installation.

   MIMP runs on top of IMP.  Therefore, you will need to set-up IMP before you
   can install MIMP.  Please see the `imp/docs/INSTALL`_ file in IMP for
   directions on how to install IMP properly.

   .. IMPORTANT:: MIMP requires the Horde Framework version 3.2+ and IMP
                  version 4.2+ to run. Although not necessary, it is
                  **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you always upgrade IMP
                  to the latest version when upgrading MIMP since any bug
                  fixes to the core libraries occur there.


Installing MIMP
===============

MIMP is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, MIMP is installed directly underneath Horde in the web
server's document tree.

Since MIMP is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary;
simply expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename
the root directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear
in the URL.  For example, with the Apache web server's default document
root of ``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/mimp-1.0.tar.gz
   mv mimp-1.0 mimp

and would then find MIMP at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/mimp/


Configuring MIMP
================

1. Configuring Horde for MIMP

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['mimp']``
      stanza.  The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired.  If you have changed the location of MIMP relative to
      Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update the
      ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

   b. Enable IMP authentication [OPTIONAL]

      See IMP's `imp/docs/INSTALL`_ file for details.

2. Configuring MIMP.

   To configure MIMP, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Or on Windows::

      copy *.dist *.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of those files can be found in each
   file.  You may edit these files if you wish to customize MIMP's appearance
   and behavior.  With two exceptions (``conf.php`` and ``servers.php``) the
   defaults will be correct for most sites.

   You must be sure to list your IMAP/POP3 server names and configuration
   information in ``servers.php`` (unless you demand that the user specify his
   own at login).

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of MIMP.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Setup`` icon to get the
   configuration page.  Select ``Mobile Mail`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Mobile Mail Configuration`` to generate the
   ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to
   the MIMP configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the
   file.  In this case, go back to ``Setup`` and choose one of the other
   methods to create the configuration file ``mimp/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: MIMP uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

3. Securing MIMP

   Before you can secure MIMP, you need a secure Horde installation.  Please
   read the file in `horde/docs/SECURITY`_ for Horde security information
   before proceeding.

   See IMP's `imp/docs/INSTALL`_ file for further details on how to secure
   IMP/MIMP.

5. Tuning MIMP (Performance)

   See `horde/docs/PERFORMANCE`_.
