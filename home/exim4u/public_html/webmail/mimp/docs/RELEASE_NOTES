The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Mobile Internet
Messaging Program (MIMP) version H3 (1.1.2).

MIMP (or Mobile IMP) is a version of the webmail client IMP suitable for
mobile devices such as WAP phones or PDAs. Basic IMP functionality is
implemented including mailbox viewing and paging, viewing messages, deleting,
replying, forwarding, and composing new messages.

MIMP requires at least Horde version 3.2 and IMP version H3 (4.2) to run.
Although not required to upgrade either Horde or IMP, it is STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED you do as any bugfixes to core functionality will occur in
these applications.

Major changes compared to the MIMP H3 (1.1.1) version are:
    * Ignore 'compose_html' preference in IMP (requires IMP 4.3.5).
    * Fix showing Cc and Bcc fields.
    * Implement custom menu items.
