The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet
Messaging Program (IMP) version H3 (4.3.5).

IMP, the Internet Messaging Program, is one of the most popular webmail
applications available.  It allows universal, web-based access to IMAP and
POP3 mail servers and provides a full range of features normally found only in
desktop email clients.

The major changes compared to IMP version H3 (4.3.4) are:
    * Highlight signed messages depending on the signature verification.
    * Added hook examples for address book preferences.
    * Fixed some javascript if using IE 8.
    * Use correct charset when rendering inline PGP data.
    * Fixed renaming shared folders contained in empty namespaces.
    * Fixed spellcheck in text-mode for certain words in non-English locales.
    * Other minor bugfixes and improvements.
