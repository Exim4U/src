In no particular order:

- Don't render large MIME parts.

- Print all messages in a mailbox.

- Add t-prot like features (http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1235,
  http://www.escape.de/users/tolot/mutt/) for text massaging. Features we
  don't already have include: Remove mailing list footers; Shrink big
  quotations; Squeeze a sequence of blank lines to just two; Change a series
  of four or more periods or exclamation points into just three; Hide overlong
  signatures.

- Implement combinations of AND and OR rules in the IMP search screen.

- Allow thread sort in search results (will require a c-client replacement and
  support on the IMAP server).
