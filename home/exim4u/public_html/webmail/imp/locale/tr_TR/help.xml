    <para>You may use your keyboard to move between messages in the mailbox list, to the previous or next messages while viewing a message, and between pages of your mailbox list.</para>
    <heading>Message List Keyboard Navigation</heading>
    <para>You can use your keyboard to select and view messages in your message list. In order to move between messages, use the Up and Down arrow keys while holding the Control (Ctrl) key. You will start at the bottom of the page (last displayed message) if you press Up, and at the top of the page (first displayed message) if you press Down.</para>
    <para>The current message is highlighted just as if you were mousing over it. While you are moving up and down through the mailbox list, you can press Space to select or deselect that message, and you can press Return to view that message.</para>

  <title>Forwarding Email</title>
  <para>When forwarding an email, you have several choices.</para>

  <heading>Forwarding from the Mailbox View</heading>
  <para>In the mailbox view, you can forward multiple messages at the same time. Each message that you select will be sent, in its entirety, to your recipients. You will see each message as an attachment in your compose window. On the receiving end, the recipient(s) will see each email as an embedded email.</para>

  <heading>Forwarding from the Message View</heading>
  <para>When forwarding individual messages in the message view, you can choose three different options:</para>
  <para><b>1. Entire Message</b>: This option will attach the entire message to your email. The compose area will not contain any text from the forwarded message. This is the same as forwading a single email from the mailbox view, except that the Subject: line will be set for you.</para>
  <para><b>2. Body Text Only</b>: If you only want to forward the body of the email, choose this option. Any attachments to the original email will not be included in your forward. The text will appear in the compose area, and you can edit it if you wish or add your own comments.</para>
  <para><b>3. Body Text with Attachments</b>: To forward the attachments of an email along, along with the body as described in #2 Body Text Only, use this option. The body text will be placed in the compose area for you to edit, and all attachments to the original message will be copied to your forward.</para>
