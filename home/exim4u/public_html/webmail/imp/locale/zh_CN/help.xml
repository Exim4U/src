    <para>You may use your keyboard to move between messages in the mailbox list, to the previous or next messages while viewing a message, and between pages of your mailbox list.</para>
    <heading>Message List Keyboard Navigation</heading>
    <para>You can use your keyboard to select and view messages in your message list. In order to move between messages, use the Up and Down arrow keys while holding the Control (Ctrl) key. You will start at the bottom of the page (last displayed message) if you press Up, and at the top of the page (first displayed message) if you press Down.</para>
    <para>The current message is highlighted just as if you were mousing over it. While you are moving up and down through the mailbox list, you can press Space to select or deselect that message, and you can press Return to view that message.</para>

  <title>Forwarding Email</title>
  <para>When forwarding an email, you have several choices.</para>

  <heading>Forwarding from the Mailbox View</heading>
  <para>In the mailbox view, you can forward multiple messages at the same time. Each message that you select will be sent, in its entirety, to your recipients. You will see each message as an attachment in your compose window. On the receiving end, the recipient(s) will see each email as an embedded email.</para>

  <heading>Forwarding from the Message View</heading>
  <para>When forwarding individual messages in the message view, you can choose three different options:</para>
  <para><b>1. Entire Message</b>: This option will attach the entire message to your email. The compose area will not contain any text from the forwarded message. This is the same as forwading a single email from the mailbox view, except that the Subject: line will be set for you.</para>
  <para><b>2. Body Text Only</b>: If you only want to forward the body of the email, choose this option. Any attachments to the original email will not be included in your forward. The text will appear in the compose area, and you can edit it if you wish or add your own comments.</para>
  <para><b>3. Body Text with Attachments</b>: To forward the attachments of an email along, along with the body as described in #2 Body Text Only, use this option. The body text will be placed in the compose area for you to edit, and all attachments to the original message will be copied to your forward.</para>

Linking attachments has the advantage of tremendously reducing the size of outgoing messages.  Linking attachments has the disadvantage that the content of the attachments can not be guaranteed to be available in the future since the attachment data is not located within the e-mail message.

    <para>
    If you want to digitally sign messages or enable others to send you encrypted messages, you must have your own personal public/private PGP keypair.
    </para>
    <heading>Your Public Key</heading>
    <para>
    Your public key should be made available to any person that you want to be able to send you encrypted messages that only YOU can decrypt (using your private key). Additionally, your public key needs to be made available to anybody you send a ddigitally signed message to - the public key is required to verify the digital signature.
    </para>
    <heading>Your Private Key</heading>
    <para>
    Your private key is necessary to decrypt any message encrypted using your public key. Additionally, your private key is needed if you want to digitally sign a message. Your private key will be protected via a passphrase created when the keys are generated. Thus, to perform any activity that requires your private key, IMP will prompt you for your passphrase. You only need to insert your passphrase once per session - IMP will store your passphrase until you logout (So be sure to logout!).

    <heading>What is S/MIME?</heading>
    <para>
    S/MIME is a private/public key pair system which provides digital signatures, message privacy, and tamper detection in a open, interoperable way.  S/MIME can provide message privacy by encrypting messages that only the sender and the intended recipients can decode.  It allows you to identify the sender of a message via a digital signature.  Together, this encryption and digital signing help provide tamper detection, allowing recipients to determine whether a message was altered after it was sent.
