    <title>Keyboard: Navigation</title>
    <para>You may use your keyboard to move between messages in the mailbox list, to the previous or next messages while viewing a message, and between pages of your mailbox list.</para>
    <heading>Message List Keyboard Navigation</heading>
    <para>You can use your keyboard to select and view messages in your message list. In order to move between messages, use the Up and Down arrow keys while holding the Control (Ctrl) key. You will start at the bottom of the page (last displayed message) if you press Up, and at the top of the page (first displayed message) if you press Down.</para>
    <para>The current message is highlighted just as if you were mousing over it. While you are moving up and down through the mailbox list, you can press Space to select or deselect that message, and you can press Return to view that message.</para>
    <heading>Message List: Previous/Next Page</heading>

  <title>Forwarding Email</title>
  <para>When forwarding an email, you have several choices.</para>

  <heading>Forwarding from the Mailbox View</heading>
  <para>In the mailbox view, you can forward multiple messages at the same time. Each message that you select will be sent, in its entirety, to your recipients. You will see each message as an attachment in your compose window. On the receiving end, the recipient(s) will see each email as an embedded email.</para>

  <heading>Forwarding from the Message View</heading>
  <para>When forwarding individual messages in the message view, you can choose three different options:</para>
  <para><b>1. Entire Message</b>: This option will attach the entire message to your email. The compose area will not contain any text from the forwarded message. This is the same as forwading a single email from the mailbox view, except that the Subject: line will be set for you.</para>
  <para><b>2. Body Text Only</b>: If you only want to forward the body of the email, choose this option. Any attachments to the original email will not be included in your forward. The text will appear in the compose area, and you can edit it if you wish or add your own comments.</para>
  <para><b>3. Body Text with Attachments</b>: To forward the attachments of an email along, along with the body as described in #2 Body Text Only, use this option. The body text will be placed in the compose area for you to edit, and all attachments to the original message will be copied to your forward.</para>

    輸入郵件的主旨。

    盡可能以簡單扼要的描述來說明主旨。
    主旨是最容易讓人能夠在日後回想起這封郵件內容的方法，
    因此在編寫郵件時主旨是相當重要的。
    而且，當你'回覆'或'轉寄'郵件時主旨也將會一併放進新郵件中，
    如此一來郵件之間才能型成一種關聯。
    然而，如果你對'回覆'或'轉寄'的郵件內容中做了些許的改變，
    或許你可以考慮在'主旨'上增加簡單的變動通知，
    如此所有的收信對象才能繼續依循此一"關聯"。

    Check this option if you want to be allowed to apply filter rules to any mailbox. Normally, filtering rules are only applied to new mail that is delivered to your INBOX. If this option is checked, an icon will appear on all mailbox pagges that will allow you to apply filter rules to the messages in the current mailbox. NOTE: Filtering in mailboxes other than INBOX may produce strange (e.g. the filter may cause a copy of messages to be delivered to the same mailbox) and/or undesired results (e.g. it may cause messages to be moved/deleted if new filtering rules have been implemented since the message has been delivered to the current mailbox).

    點選這個按鈕，會將你儲存在網路郵局偏好設定中的個人公開/私密金鑰對刪除。
    請注意：由於個人私密金鑰與個人公開金鑰是成對的，一但金鑰對建立完成使用者
    應該盡可能避免去刪除它。因為如果又再次重新建立金鑰對，之前所有寄發給朋友並流
    通在外的公開金鑰將無法與新建的私密金鑰吻合。(除非你將新建的公開金鑰重新寄發)

    <heading>什麼是 S/MIME?</heading>
    <para>
    PGP 是一種用於通訊以及資料的加密工具，特別是用於電子郵件。 
    PGP 可用於資料的加密、建立數位簽章。 網路郵局使用 GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard)
    以提供上述的服務。
    S/MIME 是另一種私密/公開金鑰對系統。該系統提供諸如：數位簽章，郵件加密，以及
    在開放共用上提供竄改偵測的技術。 S/MIME 可以提供郵件加密的功能，加密後的郵
    件只有寄送者及收件者可以解密。S/MIME 還可以經由數位簽章來辨識寄送者的郵件。
    加密與數位簽章一起使用更可以提供竄改偵測的功能，好讓所有收件對象判定郵件在
    寄發後是否曾被竄改。

    S/MIME is a private/public key pair system which provides digital signatures, message privacy, and tamper detection in a open, interoperable way. S/MIME can provide message privacy by encrypting messages that only the sender and the intended recipients can decode. It allows you to identify the sender of a message via a digital signature. Together, this encryption and digital signing help provide tamper detection, allowing recipients to determine whether a message was altered after it was sent.

    <para>* "永遠儲存附加檔案" - 在郵件編寫畫面中永遠不要提示儲存附加檔案；
    而且附加檔案永遠隨著信件一起備分。</para>

    <title>Virtual Folders: Virtual Inbox</title>
    <para>
    Virutal Inbox is a saved search that does away with the need to search every mailbox for messages marked as new.  Instead, all currently subscribed mailboxes are searched for new messages and the results are displayed in a single mailbox.
    </para>

  <entry id="virtual_trash" state="new">
    <title>Virtual Folders: Virtual Trash</title>
    <para>
    Virtual Trash is a saved search that does away with the need for a separate Trash folder.  Instead of moving messages to a centralized trash folder, messages are simply marked as deleted in the current folder they live in.  When 'show deleted messages' is turned off, this results in these messages not appearing in a mailbox view.  When a user clicks on Virtual Trash, *all* mailboxes all searched for messages that are flagged deleted and these messages are displayed in a single mailbox.
