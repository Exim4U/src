 *
 * This file is where you specify the sources of contacts available to users
 * at your installation. It contains a large number of EXAMPLES. Please
 * remove or comment out those examples that YOU DON'T NEED. There are a
 * number of properties that you can set for each server, including:
 *
 * title:       This is the common (user-visible) name that you want displayed
 *              in the contact source drop-down box.
 *
 * type:        The types 'ldap', 'sql', 'imsp', 'group', 'favourites' and
 *              'prefs' are currently supported. Preferences-based address
 *              books are not intended for production installs unless you
 *              really know what you're doing - they are not searchable, and
 *              they won't scale well if a user has a large number of entries.
 *
 * params:      These are the connection parameters specific to the contact
 *              source. See below for examples of how to set these.
 *
 * Special params settings:
 *
 *   charset:       The character set that the backend stores data in. Many
 *                  LDAP servers use utf-8. Database servers typically use
 *                  iso-8859-1.
 *
 *   tls:           Only applies to LDAP servers. If true, then try to use a
 *                  TLS connection to the server.
 *
 *   scope:         Only applies to LDAP servers. Can be set to 'one' to
 *                  search one level of the LDAP directory, or 'sub' to search
 *                  all levels. 'one' will work for most setups and should be
 *                  much faster. However we default to 'sub' for backwards
 *                  compatibility.
 *
 *   checkrequired: Only applies to LDAP servers. If present, this value causes
 *                  the driver to consult the LDAP schema for any attributes
 *                  that are required by the given objectclass(es). Required
 *                  attributes will be provided automatically if the
 *                  'checkrequired_string' parameter is present.
 *                  *NOTE* You must have the Net_LDAP PEAR library installed
 *                  for this to work.
 *
 *   checksyntax:   Only applies to LDAP servers. If present, this value causes
 *                  the driver to inspect the LDAP schema for particular
 *                  attributes by the type defined in the corresponding schema
 *                  *NOTE* You must have the Net_LDAP PEAR library installed
 *                  for this to work.
 *
 *   deref:         Only applies to LDAP servers. If set, should be one of:
 *                    LDAP_DEREF_NEVER
 *                    LDAP_DEREF_SEARCHING
 *                    LDAP_DEREF_FINDING
 *                    LDAP_DEREF_ALWAYS
 *                  This tells the LDAP server when to dereference
 *                  aliases. See http://www.php.net/ldap for more
 *                  information.
 *
 *   dn:            Only applies to LDAP servers. Defines the list of LDAP
 *                  attributes that build a valid DN.
 *
 *   objectclass:   Only applies to LDAP servers. Defines a list of
 *                  objectclasses that contacts must belong to, and
 *                  that new objects will be created with.
 *
 *   filter:        Filter helps to filter your result based on certain
 *                  condition in SQL and LDAP backends. A filter can be
 *                  specified to avoid some unwanted data. For example, if the
 *                  source is an external sql database, to select records with
 *                  the delete flag = 0:
 *                  'filter' = 'deleted=0'
 *
 * map:         This is a list of mappings from the Turba attribute names (on
 *              the left) to the attribute names by which they are known in
 *              this contact source (on the right). Turba also supports
 *              composite fields. A composite field is defined by mapping the
 *              field name to an array containing a list of component fields
 *              and a format string (similar to a printf() format string;
 *              however, note that positioned parameters like %1$s will NOT
 *              work). 'attribute' defines where the composed value is saved,
 *              and can be left out. 'parse' defines a list of format strings
 *              and field names that should be used for splitting up composite
 *              fields, in the order of precedence, and can be left out. Here
 *              is an example:
 *              ...
 *              'name' => array('fields' => array('firstname', 'lastname'),
 *                              'format' => '%s %s',
 *                              'attribute' => 'object_name'),
 *              'firstname' => 'object_firstname',
 *              'lastname' => 'object_lastname',
 *              ...
 *
 *              Standard Turba attributes are:
 *                __key     : A backend-specific ID for the entry (any value
 *                            as long as it is unique inside that source;
 *                            required)
 *                __uid     : Globally unique ID of the entry (used for
 *                            synchronizing and must be able to be set to any
 *                            value)
 *                __owner   : User name of the contact's owner
 *                __type    : Either 'Object' or 'Group'
 *                __members : Serialized PHP array with list of Group members.
 *              More Turba attributes are defined in config/attributes.php.
 *
 * tabs:        All fields can be grouped into tabs with this optional entry.
 *              This list is multidimensional hash, the keys are the tab
 *              titles.
 *              Here is an example:
 *              'tabs' => array(
 *                  'Names' => array('firstname', 'lastname', 'alias'),
 *                  'Addresses' => array('homeAddress', 'workAddress')
 *              );
 *
 * search:      A list of Turba attribute names that can be searched for this
 *              source.
 *
 * strict:      A list of native field/attribute names that must
 *              always be matched exactly in a search.
 *
 * approximate: Only applies to LDAP servers. If set, should be an
 *              array of native field/attribute names to search
 *              "approximately" (for example, "Sánchez", "Sanchez",
 *              and "Sanchéz" will all match a search string of
 *              "sanchez").
 *
 * export:      If set to true, this source will appear on the Export menu,
 *              allowing users to export the contacts to a CSV (etc.) file.
 *
 * browse:      If set to true, this source will be browseable via the Browse
 *              menu item, and empty searches against the source will return
 *              all contacts.
 *
 * use_shares:  If this is present and true, Horde_Share functionality will
 *              be enabled for this source - allowing users to share their
 *              personal address books as well as to create new ones. Since
 *              Turba only supports having one backend configured for
 *              creating new shares, use the 'shares' configuration option to
 *              specify which backend will be used for creating new shares.
 *              All permission checking will be done against Horde_Share, but
 *              note that any 'extended' permissions (such as max_contacts)
 *              will still be enforced. Also note that the backend driver
 *              must have support for using this. Currently SQL and IMSP.
 *
 * list_name_field:  If this is present and non-empty, it will be taken as the
 *                   field to store contact list names in.
 *                   This is required when using a composite field as the 'name'
 *                   field.
 *
 * alternative_name: If this is present and non-empty, it will be taken as the
 *                   field to use an alternative in case that the name field is
 *                   empty.
 *
 * Here are some example configurations:
