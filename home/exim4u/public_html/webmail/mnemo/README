Mnemo is the Horde notes and memos application.  It lets users keep free-text
notes and other bits of information which doesn't fit as a contact, a todo
item, an event, etc.  It is very similar in functionality to the Palm Memo
application.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.
