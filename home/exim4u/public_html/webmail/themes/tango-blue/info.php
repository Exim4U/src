/**
 * Tango Blue theme for Horde.
 *
 * This set does not currently (2007-03-16) follow the icon naming spec:
 * http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html
 *
 * The following directories; "rhea/graphics/avatars",
 * "rhea/graphics/emoticons" and "rhea/graphics/flags" are empty
 * because their icons cannot be replaced with tango icons. In order
 * to reduce overall filesize, it was necessary to remove them.
 *
 * Icons from Ubuntu's icon theme called "human" have been used where
 * tango does not have an appropriate icon.
 *
 * Icons/replacments can generally be found at
 * http://daniel.holba.ch/ubuntu/ic/ when not available in
 * tango-icon-theme.
