The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Nag Task List
Manager version H3 (2.3.3).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists).  It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and offers shared task lists.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H3 (2.3.2) are:
    * Improved synchronization support.
    * Display application name as task list name when listing external tasks.
    * Other minor bugfixes and improvements.
