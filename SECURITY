                               Security Precautions

The following precautions will help protect your Exim4U installation from hostile
intruders and other potential security issues.

1) Use https instead of http for web access to all files. https encrypts all data
using SSL or TLS which protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

2) If possible, password protect the entire Exim4U installation with Apache
.htaccess files. However, this may not be viable if you are allowing individuals to
change their own password, etc.

3) Install Exim4U into an unpredictable path (i.e. don't call it exim4u). The Exim4U
INSTALL file prescribes the install path as exim4u and so you may want to consider
changing the path to something else.

4) Use complex passwords that would be difficult to defeat with dictionary attacks,
etc. Passwords should contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, symbols and
other characters.
