                               Security Precautions

The following precautions will help protect your Exim4U installation from hostile
intruders and other potential security issues.

1) Use https instead of http for web access to all files. https encrypts all data
using SSL or TLS which protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

2) Install Exim4U into an unpredictable path (i.e. don't call it exim4u). The Exim4U
INSTALL file prescribes the install path as exim4u and so you may want to consider
changing the path to something else.

3) Use complex passwords that would be difficult to defeat with dictionary attacks,
etc. Passwords should contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, symbols and
other characters.

4) If possible, password protect the entire Exim4U installation with Apache .htaccess
files. However, this may not be viable if you are allowing individuals to change their
own passwords, etc. Alternatively, you may use mod_auth_mysql so that the .htaccess
file accesses the Exim4U user names and passwords from the MySQL database whereby any
valid Exim4U user can authenticate via the .htaccess file.

   Here is an example .htaccess file using mod_auth_mysql on RedHat/CentOS:

	Options -Indexes
	AuthName "Exim4U Email Admin"
	AuthType Basic
	require valid-user
	AuthMySQLEnable On
	AuthMySQLSocket /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
	AuthMySQLDB exim4u
	AuthMySQLUser exim4u
	AuthMySQLPassword "DatabasePassword"
	AuthMySQLPwEncryption Crypt
	AuthMySQLUserTable users
	AuthMySQLNameField username
	AuthMySQLPasswordField crypt
	AuthMySQLNoPasswd off

    When using this feature you must install mod_auth_mysql from the RedHat/CentOS repos
    as follows:

	yum install mod_auth_mysql

    For more information on mod_auth_mysql refer to: http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/

    Consult your documentation for how to implement mod_auth_mysql with other versions of
    Unix/Linux.
