WARNING
-------
This code is probably unsafe.

Much of the user interface for Exim4U originated from the Virtual Exim
(VExim) project and they have posted a similar warning on their github home page.

There may be security issues in this code. It was written as a helpful utility in 2004 and has had
minimal changes since then. Very little effort went in at the time to protect it against various
security attacks. While we do eventually fix security issues we become aware of, we aren't bound
by any SLAs, so fixes don't always happen quickly.

Patches to fix security issues will be accepted as time permits, but the code (especially the web
based user interface) certainly needs an overhaul, and that will only happen if someone with enough
time and motivation steps up.

In short:

    If you are considering Exim4U or VExim, we advise you to at least have a look at
    other similar solutions as well.
    If you are already using Exim4U or VExim, please consider taking extra steps to secure it.
    If you're interested in contributing a rewrite, or participating in one, let us know.
    Pull requests with bugfixes are always welcome!
