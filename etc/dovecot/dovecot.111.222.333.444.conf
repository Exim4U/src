#
#
#
# exim4u: This is the multi-IP version of the dovecot configuration file.
# You must invoke multiple sessions of Dovecot when using multiple
# IPs if you want dovecot to masquarade for each domain. You must have
# a separate config file for each IP address for which dovecot will run concurrently.
# Create a differently named copy of the dovecot.conf configuration file for each IP with these changes:
# 1. Change base_dir to the new run directory such as /var/run/dovecot/<MY_IP>
# 2. Make sure that login_dir is either commented out (default is relative to base_dir), or change it under the new directory as well
# 3. Change the listen and ssl_listen port numbers to new, unused IP values
# 4. Change the ssl_cert_file and ssl_key_file to the correct certificate info for the new unused IP values 
# 5. If you're using authentication sockets (for SMTP AUTH or deliver), you'll need to change them as well. auth_socket_path specifies the socket path for deliver.
# 6. Modify the dovecot service script by adding additional daemon commands for additional IP addresses as outlined therein under the start() subroutine. 
# 7. Replace the old dovecot service script with the new one but first make a backup of the old one.
#    eg.: cp /etc/init.d/dovecot /etc/init.d/dovecot.ORIGINAL
#         cp dovecot.new /etc/init.d/dovecot
#
# Invoke dovecot with the -c flag and the modified configuration file, e.g.: dovecot -c /usr/local/etc/dovecot.<MY_IP>.conf

# possible to specify multiple addresses. "*" listens in all IPv4 interfaces.

# interfaces depending on the operating system.
#
# If you want to specify ports for each service, you will need to configure
# these settings inside the protocol imap/pop3 { ... } section, so you can
# specify different ports for IMAP/POP3. For example:
#   protocol imap {
#     listen = *:10143
#     ssl_listen = *:10943
#     ..
#   }
#   protocol pop3 {

# Should all IMAP and POP3 processes be killed when Dovecot master process
# shuts down. Setting this to "no" means that Dovecot can be upgraded without
# forcing existing client connections to close (although that could also be

# means that after master process has died, the client processes can't write
# to log files anymore.

## Mailbox locations and namespaces
##

# Location for users' mailboxes. This is the same as the old default_mail_env
# setting. The default is empty, which means that Dovecot tries to find the
# mailboxes automatically. This won't work if the user doesn't have any mail
# yet, so you should explicitly tell Dovecot the full location.
#
# If you're using mbox, giving a path to the INBOX file (eg. /var/mail/%u)
# isn't enough. You'll also need to tell Dovecot where the other mailboxes are
# and where Dovecot can place its index files. This is called the "root mail
# directory", and it must be the first path given in the mail_location setting.
#
# There are a few special variables you can use, eg.:
#
#   %u - username
#   %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
#   %d - domain part in user@domain, empty if there's no domain
#   %h - home directory
#
# See doc/variables.txt for full list. Some examples:
#
#   mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
#   mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
#   mail_location = mbox:/var/mail/%d/%1n/%n:INDEX=/var/indexes/%d/%1n/%n
#
# http://wiki.dovecot.org/MailLocation
#
#mail_location = maildir:%h/mail/%d/%n/Maildir
#mail_location = maildir:%maildir
#
# exim4u Comment: This mail_location works if enabled it or it will
# find the maildir automatically if not enabled:
# mail_location = %h/Maildir
# Uncomment the above line to enable!
# Explanation is as follows:
# %h = home = pop (mysql variable)
# or: /home/<domain directory>/mail/<domain name>/<user part in user name>

# If you need to set multiple mailbox locations or want to change default
# namespace settings, you can do it by defining namespace sections:
#
# You can have private, shared and public namespaces. The only difference
# between them is how Dovecot announces them to client via NAMESPACE
# extension. Shared namespaces are meant for user-owned mailboxes which are
# shared to other users, while public namespaces are for more globally
# accessible mailboxes.
#
# REMEMBER: If you add any namespaces, the default namespace must be added
# explicitly, ie. mail_location does nothing unless you have a namespace
# without a location setting. Default namespace is simply done by having a
# namespace with empty prefix.
#namespace private {
   # Hierarchy separator to use. You should use the same separator for all
   # namespaces or some clients get confused. '/' is usually a good one.
   # The default however depends on the underlying mail storage format.
   #separator = 

   # Prefix required to access this namespace. This needs to be different for
   # all namespaces. For example "Public/".

   # Physical location of the mailbox. This is in same format as
   # mail_location, which is also the default for it.

   # There can be only one INBOX, and this setting defines which namespace
   # has it.
   #inbox = yes

   # If namespace is hidden, it's not advertised to clients via NAMESPACE
   # extension or shown in LIST replies. This is mostly useful when converting
   # from another server with different namespaces which you want to depricate
   # but still keep working. For example you can create hidden namespaces with
   # prefixes "~/mail/", "~%u/mail/" and "mail/".
   #hidden = yes
#}

# to give "mail" group write access to /var/mail to be able to create dotlocks.
#mail_extra_groups =

# Allow full filesystem access to clients. There's no access checks other than

## Mailbox handling optimizations
##

# Space-separated list of fields to initially save into cache file. Currently
# these fields are allowed:
#
#  flags, date.sent, date.received, size.virtual, size.physical
#  mime.parts, imap.body, imap.bodystructure
#
# Different IMAP clients work in different ways, so they benefit from
# different cached fields. Some do not benefit from them at all. Caching more
# than necessary generates useless disk I/O, so you don't want to do that
# either.
#
# Dovecot attempts to automatically figure out what client wants and it keeps
# only that. However the first few times a mailbox is opened, Dovecot hasn't
# yet figured out what client needs, so it may not perform optimally. If you
# know what fields the majority of your clients need, it may be useful to set
# these fields by hand. If client doesn't actually use them, Dovecot will
# eventually drop them.
#
# Usually you should just leave this field alone. The potential benefits are
# typically unnoticeable.
#mail_cache_fields =

# Useful if you want to save disk space at the cost of more I/O when the fields
# needed.

#mail_cache_min_mail_count = 0

# When IDLE command is running, mailbox is checked once in a while to see if

# time to wait between those checks. Dovecot is however able to use dnotify
# and inotify with Linux to reply immediately after the change occurs.
#mailbox_idle_check_interval = 30

# Save mails with CR+LF instead of plain LF. This makes sending those mails
# take less CPU, especially with sendfile() syscall with Linux and FreeBSD.
# But it also creates a bit more disk I/O which may just make it slower.
# Also note that if other software reads the mboxes/maildirs, they may handle
# the extra CRs wrong and cause problems.
#mail_save_crlf = no

##
## Maildir-specific settings
##

# By default LIST command returns all entries in maildir beginning with dot.
# Enabling this option makes Dovecot return only entries which are directories.

# done always regardless of this setting)
#maildir_stat_dirs = no

# Copy mail to another folders using hard links. This is much faster than
# actually copying the file. This is problematic only if something modifies
# the mail in one folder but doesn't want it modified in the others. I don't

# requires that the mails don't change, so it would be problematic in any case.
# If you care about performance, enable it.
#maildir_copy_with_hardlinks = no

##
## mbox-specific settings
##

# Which locking methods to use for locking mbox. There are four available:
#  dotlock: Create <mailbox>.lock file. This is the oldest and most NFS-safe
#           solution. If you want to use /var/mail/ like directory, the users
#           will need write access to that directory.
#  fcntl  : Use this if possible. Works with NFS too if lockd is used.
#  flock  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#  lockf  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#
# You can use multiple locking methods; if you do the order they're declared
# in is important to avoid deadlocks if other MTAs/MUAs are using multiple
# locking methods as well. Some operating systems don't allow using some of
# them simultaneously.

# When mbox changes unexpectedly we have to fully read it to find out what
# changed. If the mbox is large this can take a long time. Since the change
# is usually just a newly appended mail, it'd be faster to simply read the
# new mails. If this setting is enabled, Dovecot does this but still safely
# fallbacks to re-reading the whole mbox file whenever something in mbox isn't
# how it's expected to be. The only real downside to this setting is that if
# some other MUA changes message flags, Dovecot doesn't notice it immediately.
# Note that a full sync is done with SELECT, EXAMINE, EXPUNGE and CHECK 
# commands.

#mbox_very_dirty_syncs = no

# Delay writing mbox headers until doing a full write sync (EXPUNGE and CHECK

# where clients often delete all mails. The downside is that our changes
# aren't immediately visible to other MUAs.

  #     may show user "Message no longer in server" errors. Note that OE6 still
  #     breaks even with this workaround if synchronization is set to

  #   outlook-idle:
  #     Outlook and Outlook Express never abort IDLE command, so if no mail
  #     arrives in half a hour, Dovecot closes the connection. This is still

  #     arrives.
  #   netscape-eoh:
  #     Netscape 4.x breaks if message headers don't end with the empty "end of
  #     headers" line. Normally all messages have this, but setting this
  #     workaround makes sure that Netscape never breaks by adding the line if

  # Password database is used to verify user's password (and nothing more).

  #
  # http://wiki.dovecot.org/PasswordDatabase
  #
  # By adding master=yes setting inside a passdb you make the passdb a list
  # of "master users", who can log in as anyone else. Unless you're using PAM,
  # you probably still want the destination user to be looked up from passdb
  # that it really exists. This can be done by adding pass=yes setting to the
  # master passdb.
  #
  # http://wiki.dovecot.org/MasterPassword

  # Users can be temporarily disabled by adding a passdb with deny=yes.
  # If the user is found from that database, authentication will fail.
  # The deny passdb should always be specified before others, so it gets
  # checked first. Here's an example:

  #passdb passwd-file {
    # File contains a list of usernames, one per line
    #args = /etc/dovecot.deny
    #deny = yes
  #}

  # PAM authentication. Preferred nowadays by most systems. 
  # Note that PAM can only be used to verify if user's password is correct,
  # so it can't be used as userdb. If you don't want to use a separate user
  # database (passwd usually), you can use static userdb.
  # REMEMBER: You'll need /etc/pam.d/dovecot file created for PAM
  # authentication to actually work.
  # http://wiki.dovecot.org/PasswordDatabase/PAM
# exim4u MOD
# Delete out PAM authentication. dovecot was looking at pam before it's
# virtual users, which causes PAM errors in the logs and PAM will never

# out in the default config. 
##  passdb pam {

    # session=yes makes Dovecot open and immediately close PAM session. Some
    # PAM plugins need this to work, such as pam_mkhomedir.
    #
    # setcred=yes makes Dovecot establish PAM credentials if some PAM plugins
    # need that. They aren't ever deleted though, so this isn't enabled by
    # default.
    #
    # cache_key can be used to enable authentication caching for PAM
    # (auth_cache_size also needs to be set). It isn't enabled by default
    # because PAM modules can do all kinds of checks besides checking password,
    # such as checking IP address. Dovecot can't know about these checks
    # without some help. cache_key is simply a list of variables (see
    # doc/variables.txt) which must match for the cached data to be used.
    # Here are some examples:
    #   %u - Username must match. Probably sufficient for most uses.
    #   %u%r - Username and remote IP address must match.
    #   %u%s - Username and service (ie. IMAP, POP3) must match.
    # 
    # If service name is "*", it means the authenticating service name
    # is used, eg. pop3 or imap (/etc/pam.d/pop3, /etc/pam.d/imap).

    #   args = cache_key=%u dovecot

# referenced using URIs in format "proxy:<name>".

  #   dirsize: Find and sum all the files found from mail directory
  #   dict: Keep quota stored in dictionary (eg. SQL)
  #   maildir: Maildir++ quota
  #   fs: Read-only support for filesystem quota
  #quota = maildir

  # ACL plugin. vfile backend reads ACLs from "dovecot-acl" file from maildir
  # directory. You can also optionally give a global ACL directory path where
  # ACLs are applied to all users' mailboxes. The global ACL directory contains
  # one file for each mailbox, eg. INBOX or sub.mailbox.
  #acl = vfile:/etc/dovecot-acls

  # Convert plugin. If set, specifies the source storage path which is
  # converted to destination storage (mail_location).
  #convert_mail = mbox:%h/mail

  # Trash plugin. When saving a message would make user go over quota, this
  # plugin automatically deletes the oldest mails from configured mailboxes
  # until the message can be saved within quota limits. The configuration file
  # is a text file where each line is in format: <priority> <mailbox name>
  # Mails are first deleted in lowest -> highest priority number order
  #trash = /etc/dovecot-trash.conf
