# Exim ACL for greylisting. David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org>
#
# For full background on the logic behind greylisting and how this
# ACL works, see https://github.com/Exim/exim/wiki/SimpleGreylisting
#

# UPDATING TO EXIM 4.94+
# ======================
#
# Previous versions of this ACL specified the sqlite database filename 
# in the sqlite lookup strings directly, but since Exim 4.94 is it no 
# longer permitted to mix "tainted" text which comes from the message 
# itself, with the filename. Thus, you now have to set
#
# sqlite_dbfile = /var/spool/exim/db/greylist.db
#
# ... in the main configuration because it can't be specified within
# the ACL in this file any more.

# USING THIS ACL
# ==============
#
# First set sqlite_dbfile in the main configuration file to point to
# the greylist sqlite database, as described above.
#
# In your main ACLs, gather reason(s) for greylisting into a variable 
# named $acl_m_greylistreasons before invoking this ACL with
# 'require acl = greylist_mail'. The reasons should be separate lines
# of text, and will be reported in the SMTP rejection message as well
# as the log message. Anything "suspicious" about the email can be
# used as criteria here — being HTML, having even a few SpamAssassin
# points, even lacking SPF authorisation (which is OK for greylisting
# although you should never reject outright for an SPF "failure"
# because of the flaws in SPF).
#
# Obviously you need to .include this file too in order to be able
# to invoke this greylist_mail ACL.

# HOW IT WORKS
# ============
#
# When a suspicious mail is seen, we temporarily reject it and wait to see
# if the sender tries again. Most spam robots won't bother. Real mail hosts
# _will_ retry, and we'll accept it the second time. For hosts which are
# observed to retry, we don't bother greylisting again in the future --
# it's obviously pointless. We remember such hosts, or 'known resenders',
# by a tuple of their IP address and the name they used in HELO.
#
# We also include the time of listing for 'known resenders', just in case
# someone wants to expire them after a certain amount of time. So the 
# database table for these 'known resenders' looks like this:
#
# CREATE TABLE resenders (
#        host            TEXT,
#        helo            TEXT,
#        time            INTEGER,
#    PRIMARY KEY (host, helo) );
#
# To remember mail we've rejected, we create an 'identity' from its sender
# and recipient addresses and its Message-ID: header. We don't include the
# sending IP address in the identity, because sometimes the second and 
# subsequent attempts may come from a different IP address to the original.
#
# We do record the original IP address and HELO name though, because if
# the message _is_ retried from another machine, it's the _first_ one we
# want to record as a 'known resender'; not just its backup path.
#
# Obviously we record the time too, so the main table of greylisted mail
# looks like this:
#
# CREATE TABLE greylist (
#        id              TEXT,
#        expire          INTEGER,
#        host            TEXT,
#        helo            TEXT);
#
