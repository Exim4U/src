# exim4u - Host Specific Configuration Settings
#
# Specify your host's canonical name here. This should normally be the fully

# exim4u: The following lines are concerned with ident callbacks, as defined by
# RFC 1413 (hence their names). These settings cause Exim to make ident callbacks
# for all incoming SMTP calls. You can limit the hosts to which these calls are
# made, or change the timeout that is used. If you set the timeout to zero, all
# ident calls are disabled. Although they are cheap and can provide useful
# information for tracing problem messages, some hosts and firewalls have
# problems with ident calls. This can result in a timeout instead of an immediate
# refused connection, leading to delays on starting up an incoming SMTP session.

#
# exim4u: It appears that more and more DNS zone administrators are breaking the rules
# and putting domain names that look like IP addresses on the right hand side of MX
# records. Exim follows the rules and rejects this, giving an error message that
# explains the mis-configuration. However, some other MTAs support this practice,
# so to avoid "Why canâ€™t Exim do this?" complaints, allow_mx_to_ip exists, in order
# to enable this heinous activity. It is not recommended, except when you have
# no other choice.
#
allow_mx_to_ip = true
#
# exim4u: If using DKIM for outgoing mail then set DKIM_ON = YES here.
# You must also generate and save SSL keys and place the DKIM TXT record

#
# exim4u: Exim4u's multiple IP option is set here. This option allows the mail server
# to masquarade as multiple domains each with their own tls certificate as specified.
# If MULTI_IP = YES, then the IP address that is designated for each local domain
# within the exim4u's web interface is advertised during outgoing SMTP sessions
# instead of the default main IP address. For incoming mail, the IP address
# is designated by $received_ip_address. The domain name that is advertised
# is the PTR record for each IP. Therefore, reverse DNS records must be
# published for each domain. If MULTI_IP =NO, then the primary IP address
# and primary_hostname is used instead. If you are using a router such that the 
# machine's IP address is not public (192.168.*.*) then we recommend that you set
# MULTI_IP = NO. Complete instructions for configuring Exim4U's multi IP option
# are included at the bottom of this file.

# exim4u: Sender ratelimiting may be enabled or disabled with the variable, SENDER_RL.
# SENDER_RL should be set to YES to enable sender rate limiting or set to NO to disable.

# exim4u: MailMan Configuration
#
# exim4u: If mailman is installed then several mailman specific parameters must be specified in the web 
# interface's config file: home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config/variables.php. Setting $mailmaninstalled
# to "yes" in the web interface's config file will cause mailman's web interface to be accessable from
# within Exim4U's web interface for each domain. Refer to the documentation in
# home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config/variables.php for further guidance for setting up mailman in
# the Exim4U web interface.

# exim4u: Put your mailman domains here (separated by ":")
# If you don't have any mailman domains then set the domainlist to null as follows.
# domainlist mm_domains = :
# This is how the domainlist should look for multiple domains.
# domainlist mm_domains = mailman_domain_name_1.tld :  mailman_domain_name_2.tld : mailman_domain_name_3.tld

#
# exim4u: Specify vacation autoreply message parameters. This feature limits autoreplys for
# each sender to one autoreply per time period in order to avoid email ping pong infinite
# loops. Specify AR_ONCE_FILE which defines the recipient's "once" files that track autoreplies
# by recepient. The directory path must exist or be created. Specify AR_SUBJECT_TXT which is
# the text/language to be used in the autoreply subject field. Specify AR_ONCE_REPEAT which is
# how often the vacation autoreply can be sent. The default value of 1d means that senders will
# only receive 1 autoreply per day no matter how many emails are sent. 1s means that senders
# may receive 1 autoreply per second which essentially enables autoreply for all email received.
# A setting of zero time for AR_ONCE_REPEAT prevents a message from being sent a second time
# forever. In that case, zero means infinity.

#
# exim4u: The smtp_accept_queue_per_connection option limits the number of delivery processes
# that exim starts automatically when receiving messages via SMTP. If the value of the option is
# greater than zero, and the number of messages received in a single SMTP session exceeds this
# number, subsequent messages are placed in the queue, but no delivery processes are started. This
# helps to limit the number of exim processes when a server restarts after downtime and there is a lot
# of mail waiting for it on other systems. On large systems and dial-in client systems the default should
# probably be increased or set to zero (zero means disabled). Systems with large mailing lists should
# also increase or disable it.  The default value is 10 if unspecified. The following message will appear
# in the exim logs if the default value of 10 is being exceeded: "no immediate delivery: more than 10
# messages received in one connection". Uncomment the following line to disable smtp_accept_queue_per_connection.
#
# smtp_accept_queue_per_connection = 0

#
# DKIM CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
# -------------------------------
#
# SIGNING OUTGOING MAIL WITH DKIM
#
# 1) Generate private and public SSL keys and save the keys in /etc/pki/tls/dk as follows.
#       cd /etc/pki/tls
#       mkdir dk
#       cd dk
#       openssl genrsa -out rsa.private 1024
#       openssl rsa -in rsa.private -out rsa.public -pubout -outform PEM
#       chown -R exim.exim /etc/pki/tls/dk
#       chmod go-r -R /etc/pki/tls/dk
#
#    The private key is named rsa.private and the public key is named rsa.public. Both are
#    stored in the /etc/pki/tls/dk directory.
#
#    Save whats between ---BEGIN PUBLIC KEY--- and ---END PUBLIC KEY--- from the public key
#    for use in step 2 below, however, get rid of the line feeds so that the key is one long line.
#
# 2) Configure Bind (named) zone files.
#
#    Edit the zone files for all hosted mail domains, and add the following TXT records:
#
#       _domainkey.domain.tld.       IN      TXT     "t=y; o=-"
#       exim4u._domainkey.domain.tld.  IN      TXT     "k=rsa; t=y; p= <public key>"
#
#    In the above two lines, domain.tld is the FQDN for the hosted domain. Also, In the second
#    TXT record above, <public key> is the public key saved as one line without line
#    feeds as described above in step 1. Also, note that "exim4u" is the dkim_selector in the
#    transports sections of /etc/exim/exim.conf.
#
# 3) Modify /etc/named.conf (or var/named/chroot/etc/named.conf if running chrooted Bind/named).
#
#    In both your primary and secondary name servers add the following to the options section
#    of named.conf which allows the use of _(underscore):
#
#       check-names master ignore;
#
# 4) Set "DKIM_ON = YES" in this file (exim4u_local.conf.inc).
#
# FILTERING INCOMING MAIL WITH DKIM
#
# The ACL that filters incoming mail with DKIM is contained in exim4u_acl_check_dkim.conf.inc
# within the /etc/exim directory. Instructions on enabling various greylisting options as well
# as the option to reject mail with DKIM failures is contained in the ACL. Modify this ACL as
# deemed appropriate for your installation.
#
#
#
# MULTI IP CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
# -----------------------------------
#
# With MULTI_IP = YES, exim4u allows an infinite number of domains to masquarade as the host
# mail server and each of these domains may have their own IP address and SSL certificate/key. With
# MULTI_IP= NO, exim4u uses only one server host name, IP address and SSL certificate/key for all
# hosted domains.
#
# The variable, $multi_ip, must also be set likewise to either "yes" or "no" in the web interface's
# config file: home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config/variables.php.  Refer to the documentation in
# home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config/variables.php for further guidance for setting the Multi IP
# option in the web interface.
#
# For MULTI_IP = NO, the tls certificate and key for your primary_hostname is stored here:
# /etc/pki/tls/exim_tls/exim.cert
# /etc/pki/tls/exim_tls/exim.key
#
# For MULTI_IP = YES, tls certificates and keys for each domain/IP are stored here:
# /etc/pki/tls/exim_tls/exim.MY_IP.cert
# /etc/pki/tls/exim_tls/exim.MY_IP.key
# where MY_IP = Transport's interface IP address. As an example, if a domain's IP address is
# 111.222.333.444 then the certificate is stored here: /etc/pki/tls/exim_tls/exim.111.222.333.444.cert
#
# To accomplish this, a unique IP address must be assigned to each domain and the mail server should
# be configured as follows:
#
# For each IP/domain that is added, the following must be perfomed:
# 1. Modify the DNS zone file in /var/named.  Add "A" and "MX" records for each IP/domain. Also,
#    for each IP/domain, modify the spf record to include the new IP and mx address.
# 2. Reverse DNS records (PTR records) must be published for each domain. The PTR lookup of each
#    IP address must result in the domain name that is designated in your DNS zone files for that IP 
#    address in your multi-IP installation. PTR records are typically not designated in your DNS zone
#    file but must be set by your ISP or hosting provider.
# 3. For each domain, generate a self-signed SSL certificate or purchase an SSL certificate.
#    Add each domain's SSL certificate and key files to /etc/pki/tls/exim-tls. The file names
#    should be: exim.MY_IP.cert and exim.MY_IP_key where MY_IP is the ip address for the
#    certificate's domain. eg: MY_IP = 111.222.333.444.  Make sure that file ownerships for the
#    certificates and keys are all set to exim.  That is;
#    chown exim.exim -R /etc/pki/tls/exim-tls
# 4. Add all domains and IPs to the local host's file named: /etc/exim/exim4u_hostnames+hostIPs
# 5. If using relays then, on the local host, add the domain of each relay server to either of
#    the following files as per your config:
#       /etc/exim/exim4u_backup_mx_host_names or;
#       /etc/exim/exim4u_backup_mx_rl_host_names
# 6. Add a new Dovecot configuration file for each IP address and put it in /etc/dovecot. The 
#    Dovecot configuration file names should be dovecot.MY_IP.conf where MY_IP is the IP
#    address for the domain.  Then, modify the /etc/init.d/dovecot service to include all dovecot
#    configuration files (for each IP). That is, a daemon should be configured to start for each
#    configuration file in /etc/init.d/dovecot.
# 7. Using exim4u's web interface, set the "Outgoing IP" to the "A" DNS record for each local
#    domain. The local domain's "Outgoing IP" must be an IP address and not a FQDN.
# 8. For relay hosts do the following: Using exim4u's web interface, set the "Relay Server Address"
#    for each domain.  The "Relay Server Address" may be either the IP address or the FQDN.
