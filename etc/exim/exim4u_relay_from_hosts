# This setting specifies IP addresses that can use our host as an outgoing
# relay to any other host on the Internet. Such a setting commonly refers
# to a complete local network as well as the localhost. These are trusted
# hosts and no spam checking is performed.  Virus checking, however, is
# performed. For example:
# 127.0.0.1
# 192.168.0.0/16
127.0.0.1
