			Planned Exim4U Feature Enhancements 


1) Implement Mail Archiving for both local and relay domains. Include an archived mail
retrieval methodology and/or system.

2) Implement system wide admin option for ClamAV to scan both incoming and outgoing
mail or alternatively only scan incoming mail. Exim4U currently scans both incoming
and outgoing mail. So, this is simply an admin option to disable scanning of outgoing
mail by ClamAV.

3) Implement user option for white-listing sender email addresses so that mail from
those users will never be tagged as spam when the Spamassassin score is greater than
the SpamTagScore. Currently, this is achieved with Spamassassin's configuration
files on a system wide or domain basis.

4) Add support for the PostgreSQL data base. Write PostgreSQL database installation
scripts, modify Exim configuration files and update documentation for PostgreSQL.

5) Implement a script to notify users and the administrator when any user's mailbox
size quota is about to be exceeded. This would be a shell script, similar to spamdel and 
spamreport, which would send an email to the user and the administrator if the user's
disk usage exceeded a preset fraction of the user's quota.
