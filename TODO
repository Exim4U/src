			Planned Exim4U Feature Enhancements 


1) Implement DKIM for Exim 4.70. This will be Exim4U version 1.2 within which DomainKeys
will not be supported.  DomainKeys will continue to be supported on Exim4U version 1.1
with Exim 4.69 for a time frame that has yet to be determined. Note that Exim 4.70's
implementation of DKIM causes the obsolescence of DomainKeys with Exim.

2) Implement Mail Archiving for both local and relay domains. Include an archived mail
retrevial methodology and/or system.

3) Admin system wide option for ClamAV to scan both incoming and outgoing mail or 
alternatively only scan incoming mail. Exim4U currently scans both incoming and outgoing 
mail. So, this is simply a user option to disable scanning of outgoing mail by ClamAV.

4) User option for whitelisting sender email addresses so that mail from those users
will not be tagged as spam when the Spamassassin score is greater than the SpamTagScore.
