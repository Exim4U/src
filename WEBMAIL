               Exim4U Webmail Groupware Installation Documentation

Exim4U Webmail Groupware is a modified version of Horde Groupware Webmail. Prior
versions of Exim4U included Webmail Groupware that was based on Horde Version 3
whereas this Exim4U version (Exim4U version 2.0 and later) includes Webmail Groupware 
that is based on Horde Version 4. Horde Version 4 is a significant upgrade over Horde
Version 3 with much improved AJAX frontends for the various Horde modules along with
a new installation process using the PEAR installer. Prior versions of Exim4u included
Webmail Groupware in the tar format whereas Exim4u version 2.0 and later will rely on the
Horde PEAR installer. The Horde PEAR installer has several advantages including a much
easier installation/configuration process and installations may be updated at will
immediately after new Horde versions are released.

This WEBMAIL instruction file includes the necessary instructions for installing,
upgrading and maintaining Exim4U Webmail Groupware using the Horde PEAR installer.
Once installed, Horde is then easily customized for Exim4U using three shell
scripts which transform Horde Groupware Webmail into Exim4u Webmail Groupware.
Additional configuration instructions are included but are optional according to
the needs of each individual installation.

The following is the table of contents for this file:

	1) Horde PEAR Installation Documents
	2) Webmail Groupware Prerequisite Software
	3) First Time Installation Instructions
	4) Upgrading An Existing Installation
	5) Recommended Configuration Settings
	6) File Permissions
	7) Customizing Preferences And Appearance
	8) Exim4U Shell Scripts

Table of Contents items 1 and 2 are provided primarily for reference purposes. In most
cases, you may skip directly to item 3 for first time installations or item 4 for upgrades.  


1) Horde PEAR Installation Documents

The Horde INSTALL document is available at the following link:

	http://www.horde.org/apps/webmail/docs/INSTALL

The Horde UPGRADING document is available at the following link:

	http://www.horde.org/apps/webmail/docs/INSTALL


2) Webmail Groupware Prerequisite Software

All prerequisite software required for Horde Version 4 must be installed as listed
in the Horde INSTALL file.

The most significant new requirement is PHP 5.2.0 or higher. 


3) First Time Installation Instructions

First time installations are defined as follows:
 
        - New Exim4U Webmail Groupware Installation 
          (eg.: New Horde 4 Groupware Webmail Installation)
        - Upgrade of Webmail Groupware from Exim4U versions prior to 2.0 
          (eg.: Upgrade from Horde Groupware Webmail versions prior to Horde 4.)

Comprehensive installation instructions are included in the Horde INSTALL file at the
above link listed in Section 1 entitled Horde PEAR Installation Documents. The following
instructions are more brief and will suffice for most installations.

Run the following commands to setup the horde pear channel:

	pear channel-discover pear.horde.org
	pear install horde/horde_role
	pear run-scripts horde/horde_role

Then, execute the following command to install Horde Groupware Webmail Edition:

	pear install -a -B horde/webmail 

For first time installations the horde mysql user and horde mysql database must be
setup using mysql or phpmyadmin.  The horde user must be setup as follows:

	user=horde, host=localhost, password set, global privileges=Usage, Grant=No.

Then run:

	webmail-install.

Answer the questions from webmail-install as follows:

	- What database to use: mysql
	- Persistent connections: No
	- User name to connect to database: horde
	- Password to connect to database: CHANGE (Enter a secure password here.)
	- How To connect to database: Unix Sockets
	- Location of Unix Sockets: /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock for RedHat/CentOS.
	  Refer to your documentation for the socket location on other distros.
	- Database name to use: horde
	- Character set: utf-8
	- Certificate Authority: None (Unless your mysql server is remote.)
	- Split Reads: Disabled
	- Administrator Email Address: Enter a valid Admin email address.

In the future, you can use mysql or phpmyadmin to access the horde data base
and change the mysql horde password as desired.

Set the ownerships and permissions as described in Section 6 of this WEBMAIL document
entitled File Permissions.

Install the Exim4U preferences and appearance features with the following two scripts
in the xtrasw/webmail_admin directory.  These two scripts should be run from
within the webmail_admin directory as follows:

	./webmail_exim4u_prefs
	./webmail_exim4u_logos

Then, as outlined in step 7 of the Horde INSTALL file under section 1 entitled Quick Install,
run:

        https://<domainname.com>>/webmail/test.php  (if using SSL)
or;
        http://<domainname.com>>/webmail/test.php  (if not using SSL)

Keep installing pear and pecl modules until all red colored prerequisites are
gone in the test.php scripts display.

Lastly, check your file permissions again as described in section 6 of this WEBMAIL document. 

Finally, you can access webmail's web interface with:

	https://<domainname.com>>/webmail
	or;
	http://<domainname.com>>/webmail

Use the email address that you specified when you ran webmail-install and the associated
password to login to Webmail as the Administrator..


4) Upgrading An Existing Installation

Comprehensive upgrading instructions are included in the Horde UPGRADING file at the
above link listed in Section 1 entitled Horde PEAR Installation Documents. The following
instructions are more brief and will suffice for most installations.

Execute the following command to upgrade Horde Groupware Webmail Edition:

        pear upgrade -a -B horde/webmail

Set the ownerships and permissions as described in Section 6 entitled File Permissions.

Install the Exim4U appearance features with the following script from this distribution
at xtrasw/webmail_admin.  This script should be run from the webmail_admin directory as:

        ./webmail_exim4u_logos

You should not ever need to reinstall the Exim4U preferences after upgrades since the
files are stored as *.local.conf, however, if you want to reinstall the Exim4U preferences
then run the following script:

	./webmail_exim4u_prefs

5) Recommended Configuration Settings

Log into the horde web interface and make the following changes:

	Go to: 	Adminstration > Configuration > Groupware (horde) > General Tab

	Change the following setting which specifies the directory for Webmail Groupware
	relative to Apache's document root:

		$conf['cookie']['path'] = '/webmail'   <-- Define path from document root.

	Afterward, save changes by “Generate Horde Configuration".

	Go to: Adminstration > Configuration > Groupware (horde) > Spell Checker

	Specify to use the aspell command line for spell checking:

		$conf[spell] [driver] = aspell (command line)

	Specify the location of the aspell binary:

		$conf[spell] [params][path] = /usr/bin/aspell   <-- Path to aspell.

	Afterward, save changes by “Generate Horde Configuration".

	Go to: Adminstration > Configuration > Groupware (horde) > Mailer Tab

	Change the following settings:

	 	Mailer: “Use a SMTP server”.
		Host: “localhost”
		Port: “25”
		Local hostname/domain: “localhost”
		SMTP Authentication: “No Authentication”

	Afterward, save changes by “Generate Horde Configuration".

	Go to Administration > Setup > Horde > Database

	Verify the following:

	        Database: Mysql
        	Persistent connections: Yes (Check)
        	User Name: horde
        	Password: CHANGE
        	Database Connection: UNIX Sockets
        	Socket: /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
        	Database Name: horde
        	Charset: utf-8
        	Split Reads: Disabled

	Afterward, save changes by “Generate Horde Configuration".

	Go to Adminstration > Configuration > Groupware (horde) > Logging

	Change the following settings:

		$conf[log][type]: File
       		$conf[log][name]: /tmp/horde.log   <-- Creates Horde Log File at /tmp/horde.log

	Afterward, save changes by “Generate Horde Configuration".

	Go to Adminstration > Configuration > Groupware (horde) > Menu Tab

	Select the following apps:

		imp, ingo, kronolith, mnemo, nag and turba.

	Afterward, save changes by “Generate Horde Configuration".
	
  	Now, go to each application (Administration > Configuration > App name) and specify
	the menu tab accordingly for Address Book, Calendar, Filters, Mail, Notes and Tasks..  

Configure METAR Weather For Horde Portal Home Page

	Install the PEAR Services_Weather module as root from the command line:

		pear install Services_Weather

	Then, go to Horde Portal > Add Content > Add > Groupware Metar Weather

	You should now be able to pick a location and setup weather preferences. However,
	if the Location fields do not include any choices then you will need to do the
	following:

		cd /usr/share/pear/data/Services_Weather

		Modify line 273 in buildMetarDB.php file from:
			
			if (extension_loaded("zlib")) {
		to:
			if (extension_loaded("zlibXXXX")) {

		php buildMetarDB.php -a -u horde_db_user -p horde_db_pass -d horde_db
		php buildMetarDB.php -l -u horde_db_user -p horde_db_pass -d horde_db

		The horde_db_user is usually named "horde" and the horde_db is also
		usually named "horde".If database is not on localhost, you might add
		 options -h <hostname> and -r tcp.

	Now, check the metarAirports and metarLocations tables in the horde database and
	they should be populated with metar data sites.

	See: http://wiki.horde.org/MetarWeather?referrer=HowTo


6) File Permissions

When your installation or upgrade is complete the last thing that you should do
is check the file permissions for the configuration files.

Set the ownership group for the webmail directory and all of its contents so that it is
readable by Apache. This can be done as follows (for RedHat/CentOS):

        chown -R exim4u:apache webmail
        chmod -R g+r webmail

If your Apache version runs as a different user/group then you should modify the chown
command accordingly.

There are a number of configuration files that require read/write apache permission.
There is a script to set these permissions automatically in this distribution at
xtrasw/webmail_admin/webmail_fix_ownerships.  This script should be run from the
webmail_admin directory as:

        ./webmail_fix_ownerships

If your Apache version runs as a different user/group then you should modify the chown
commands in the webmail_fix_ownerships script accordingly.

These are the directories that must have read and write permission for the apache user:

webmail/turba/config
webmail/imp/config
webmail/kronolith/config
webmail/mnemo/config
webmail/nag/config
webmail/config
webmail/ingo/config

These are the files that must have read and write permission for the apache user:

webmail/turba/config/conf.bak.php
webmail/imp/config/conf.bak.php
webmail/kronolith/config/conf.bak.php
webmail/mnemo/config/conf.bak.php
webmail/nag/config/conf.bak.php
webmail/config/conf.bak.php
webmail/ingo/config/conf.bak.php
webmail/turba/config/conf.php
webmail/imp/config/conf.php
webmail/kronolith/config/conf.php
webmail/mnemo/config/conf.php
webmail/nag/config/conf.php
webmail/config/conf.php
webmail/ingo/config/conf.php

The siteadmin password is stored in /webmail/config/conf.php and is backed up to
webmail/config/conf.bak.php.  So, these files should be set so that the owner
has read/write access, the group (apache) has read/write access and all other users
have no access:

        chmod 660 <target document root directory>/webmail/config/conf*php
Example:

        chmod 660  /home/exim4u/public_html/webmail/config/conf*php


7) Customizing Preferences And Appearance

You may customize the Preferences and Appearance as desired. Refer to the APPEARANCE file
in this distribution's root directory for customizing Webmail Groupware's appearance. You
may also modify the *.local.php files in the various Horde module directories to change
your preferences. Refer to the preference modifications in the *.local.php files in 
the xtrasw/webmail_admin/webmail_exim4u_prefs script for further guidance.

8) Exim4U Shell Scripts

Three shell scripts are provided in the xtrasw/webmail_admin directory as follows:

./webmail_exim4u_logos - Script for installing the Exim4U appearance features (logos and icons).
./webmail_exim4u_prefs - Script for installing the Exim4U preferences.
./webmail_fix_ownerships - Script for properly setting file permissions.
