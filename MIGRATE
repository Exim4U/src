              Instructions For Migrating From Virtual Exim 2.2 (vexim2) to Exim4U

These instructions cover the necessary steps to migrate from Virtual Exim 2.2 to Exim4U.


1) Perform steps 1 through 4 in the INSTALL help file in this distributions root directory.

2) Migrate the MySQL database from Virtual Exim to Exim4U as follows.

If you are running a version of Virtual Exim prior to 2.2 then you need to migrate the MySQL
database to Virtual Exim 2.2 prior to migrating to Exim4U.  Alternatively, you can use phpMyAdmin
to migrate from any version of Virtual Exim to Exim4U simply by copying the old database to a new
database named exim4u and then making the necessary changes and additions for the database to match
the schema in the exim4u database as described in the /mysql/mysql.sql script.

Please note that Exim4U requires MySQL and currently does not support PostgreSQL. So, if you were
running Virtual Exim with PostgreSQL then you will need to migrate your databases manually.

To migrate the MySQL database from Virtual Exim 2.2 to Exim4U, simply run the following command
from within this distributions root directory:

	mysql -u<user_name> -p<password> < mysql_migrate/mysql_migrate.sql

	where: <username> = Your MYSQL root username
	       <password> = Your MYSQL root username's password

This command will create the new exim4u database and will also copy all of your vexim data over
to the new exim4u database.

For example, if <username> = root
	 	<password> = secret

Then, the command would be:

	mysql -uroot -psecret < mysql_migrate/mysql_migrate.sql

Your exim4u database should have now been created and your vexim data copied over to the
exim4u database.

3) The vacation autoreply message field in the MySQL database should now be expanded to be
larger than the default 255 characters in vexim2.  To expand this field to Exim4U's 4096
characters, run the following command from within this distributions root directory:

mysql -u<user_name> -p<password> exim4u < mysql_migrate/mysql_expand_vacation.sql

where: <username> = Your MYSQL root username
       <password> = Your MYSQL root username's password

For example, for user_name=MYNAME and password=SECRET then the command would be:
        mysql -uMYNAME -pSECRET exim4u < mysql_migrate/mysql_expand_vacation.sql

4) The simple mailing list mysql table needs to be created. To create this table, run
the following command from within this distributions root directory:

mysql -u<user_name> -p<password> exim4u < mysql_migrate/mysql_mailing_list.sql

where: <username> = Your MYSQL root username
       <password> = Your MYSQL root username's password

For example, for user_name=MYNAME and password=SECRET then the command would be:
        mysql -uMYNAME -pSECRET exim4u < mysql_migrate/mysql_mailing_list.sql

5) Continue on step 6 of the INSTALL help file and continue through all remaining steps.
