The included exim rpms are from the ATrpms.net repository. ATrpms' installation instuctions are here:

http://atrpms.net/install.html

A brief how-to is as follows:

NOTE: The respective dependencies must be installed prior to installing the exim RPMs. These dependencies are included in the
      'depencencies' directory for each respective RPM.

From the directory that contains the RPM-GPG-KEY.atrpms file:

        rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY.atrpms

From the appropriate exim rpm directory for your installation:

	yum localinstall <exim_appropriate.rpm(s)>

For Version_4.69-36.el5.i386 and Version_4.69-36.el5.x86_64 both the exim and the exim-mysql rpms must be installed.
