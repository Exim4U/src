# Spambox Deletion Utility
# This shell script deletes all mail in each user's spambox (server spam folder)
# that is over 10 days old.  A log is produced named /var/log/spamcron_today.log
# This utility assumes that the spam folders are located at:
# /home/*/mail/*/*/Maildir/.INBOX.spam
# If your mail folders are located elsewhere then you will need to modify this
# script accordingly.
# Also, if you want to change the time to delete from 10 days to another value,
# then change the value of mtime in the lines below.
