                           Exim4U Version History

                      Current Exim4U Version Is 2.0.1
          Upgrade Instructions Are Included In The CHANGELOG File


2.0.1 Release Date: October 6, 2011

  Simple Mailing List Added To Exim4U's Web Interface

     Exim4U now includes a mailing list manager module called the Simple Mailing List.
     This module is accessibly from within the Exim4U web interface and is similar in
     functionality to dedicated mailing list manager packages but with substantially
     fewer features. The Simple Mailing List is not meant as a direct replacement for
     dedicated mailing list manager packages since it has a much smaller feature set,
     however, it offers a quick and simple alternative for basic mailing lists especially
     for installations where no other mailing list manager is installed. 

  Exim4U Webmail Groupware Is Now Based On Horde Version 4 And Uses The Horde Pear Installer

     Horde Version 4 is a significant upgrade over Horde version 3 with much improved
     AJAX frontends for the various modules along with a new installation process using
     the PEAR installer. The Horde PEAR installer has several advantages including a
     much easier installation/configuration process and installations may be updated at
     will immediately after new Horde versions are released. Scripts are provided which
     will automatically configure the Exim4U preferences, appearance features and file
     ownerships/permissions.

 Revised Documentation

     The following documents were revised: APPEARANCE, DEBIAN, MIGRATE, SPAMASSASSIN,
     and WEBMAIL.

  Other

     Exim4U web interface has been streamlined to be simpler and more consistent for
     improved usability.

     OpenProtect's rule channel has been removed from the recommended Spamassassin
     configuration since the OpenProtect channel is now obsolete.

     The spamreport script would not run properly on Debian/Ubuntu which is now fixed.

     Problem Discovered with empty crypt field on Debian Squeeze was resolved with
     a modification to the crypt_password function in config/function.php.

     Various improvement and bug fixes.

1.2.5 Release Date: January 26, 2011

  Exim Configuration's URIBL/SURBL/DBL Blocklists (exim_surbl) Upgraded

     Upgraded exim_surbl from version 2.0 to version 2.2. This new version of exim_surbl
     adds the Spamhaus DBL list for enhanced spam prevention and supports the new SURBL
     implementation guidelines.

     exim_surbl version 2.2 is described here: http://www.teuton.org/~ejm/exim_surbl

  Revised Exim Configuration's Vacation Autoreply Transport Configuration

     The new vacation autoreply transport configuration limits autoreplys for each sender
     to one autoreply per user specified time period (default = 1 day) in order to avoid
     email ping pong infinite loops with mailing lists, etc.

  Revised Documentation

     The following documents were revised to reflect the upgrade of exim_surbl from
     version 2.0 to version 2.2: README, INSTALL, NOTES, and SPAMASSASSIN.

     The following document was added which contains a crontab script necessary
     for the implementation of exim_surbl version 2.2: etc/exim/exim.pl/README2.

     The MIGRATE document was changed to include instructions for expanding the vacation
     autoreply message field in the MySQL database.

     The DEBIAN file was amended to include instructions for the location of the
     greylisting db file and the vacation autoreply db files. While the db file
     locations in the instructions work fine in RedHat/CentoS and FreeBSD they
     have been reported to conflict with Debian's exim4-base cron.daily script.

  Other

     Bug fix to adminuserchange.php related to the vacation autoreply text for admin users.

     Expanded the vacation autoreply message field in the MySQL database to 4096 characters.

     The smtp_accept_queue_per_connection configuration option was added to exim4u_local.conf.inc.
     This option specifies the maximum number of delivery processes that exim starts automatically
     when receiving messages via SMTP. If not specified, a default value of 10 is used, however, 
     on large systems and/or systems with large mailing lists, this parameter should be increased
     or set to zero (zero means disabled).
     
     Other minor enhancements were implemented to several of the documentation files and
     the exim configuration files.

  Credits

     The vacation autoreply modifications were contributed by Jörg Roßdeutscher who also
     recommended the additions to the DEBIAN documentation file.  The upgrade to exim_surbl
     2.2 and the smtp_accept_queue_per_connection configuration option was suggested by
     Odhiambo Washington.  Thanks Jörg and Odhiambo!



1.2.4 Release Date: October 21, 2010

  Webmail Groupware Upgraded To Version Horde-1.2.7

    Webmail Groupware (home/exim4u/public_html/webmail) was upgraded to incorporate Horde
    Webmail Groupware Version 1.2.7.

  Revised Exim Configuration Files (/etc/exim):

    exim.conf was revised so that sender address callout verifications are only
    performed for spammy mail (spam score > 0). Also, minor modifications were made to
    the in-line documentation in exim.conf and exim4u_local.conf.inc to improve clarity.

  Revised Documentation:

    WEBMAIL - Minor modifications were made to the Webmail instructions to improve clarity.
    TODO - Revised to include an additional item 5 - Mailbox size quota notification script.



1.2.3 Release Date: May 13, 2010

  Critical Security Release:

    Version 1.2.3 is a critical security release. As such, all Exim4U installations
    should immediately be upgraded to version 1.2.3.  This release addresses 
    several security vulnerabilities in Exim4u v1.2.2 that were inherited from 
    the base Vexim 2.2.1 php code.  In addition to resolving the security issues 
    identified, it tightens other areas of the php code effectively reducing the 
    potential for additional undiscovered vulnerabilities being present in the 
    tightened areas.

  New Documentation:

    SECURITY - Instructions for implementing additional administrative precautions
    to help protect your Exim4U installation from hostile intruders and other
    potential security issues.

  Other:

    Minor enhancements were implemented to several of the documentation files and
    the exim configuration files.

  Credits:

    The security vulnerabilities were identified by Mike Garratt who also provided
    guidance in fixing the identified issues as well as personally correcting many
    of the weaknesses himself. Thanks Mike!



1.2.2 Release Date: February 21, 2010

  New Documentation:

    APPEARANCE - Instructions for customizing Exim4U's icons, images and appearance.
    EXIM_4.69 - Instructions for running Exim Version 4.69 instead of 4.71.
    FREEBSD, DEBIAN and REDHAT-CENTOS - OS specific installation notes.

  Exim Configuration Changes:

    Bug fixed in the acl_smtp_data ACL in exim.conf related to running exim
    with clamd disabled.

    Minor enhancement to SpamAssassin header rewriting in exim.conf.

    Moved several parameter settings from exim.conf to exim4u_local.conf.inc:
        exim_user
        exim_group
        av_scanner
        spamd_address

    Added default setting for mailman domain list in exim4u_local.conf.inc:
        domainlist mm_domains = :

    The variable, SENDER_RL, was added to exim4u_local.conf.inc which toggles
    sender ratelimiting ON/OFF in etc/exim/exim4u_acl_check_dkim.conf.inc.
    SENDER_RL = YES (on) /NO (off).

  Shell Scripts:

    Minor modifications were made to the following scripts:
	eximstats.sh
	spamdel
	spamreport
    The mailx/nail commands from the Heirloom project were also added to these
    scripts for mailing the reports.

    The spam deletion utility, spamdel, was completely rewritten to produce an
    improved report appearance and to be more easily configured for any mailstore
    locations (mailroot directories).

  Other:

    The HTML menu scripts in the following directories were modified to support site
    specific appearance modifications (logos, images, etc.):
        home/exim4u/public_html/admin_menu
        home/exim4u/public_html/user_menu

    The Exim4U Email Admin PHP scripts were modified in the following directories to
    support site specific appearance modifications (header text, logos, images, etc.):
        home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config
        home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images

    All Exim4U logos were modified for improved appearance. The Exim4U admin icon was
    replaced with a new check mark icon along with another icon which is a "human"
    image and which may be alternatively used as the Exim4U admin icon.

    All tab characters were removed from the Exim4U Email Admin PHP code since some
    custom installations of Apache appeared not to handle tabs well.

    Other minor bug fixes, modifications and documentation improvements.



1.2.1 Release Date: February 21, 2010

  Bug fix for mysql setup scripts where on_spamboxreport field in the users table was
  improperly named on-spambox_report. mysql_migrate/mysql_migrate.sql and 
  mysql_setup/mysql.sql scripts were revised where the field named on-spambox_report
  was replaced with the name on_spamboxreport in the users table.



1.2.0 Release Date: February 21, 2010

  Exim4U Version 1.2.0 requires Exim version 4.71 or higher for complete functionality.

  DKIM was implemented. DKIM signing of outgoing mail and DKIM verification of
  imcoming mail was implemented with or without greylisting and/or failure rejection
  during the SMTP session.

  Note that Exim 4.7x's implementation of DKIM causes the obsolescence of DomainKeys
  with the Exim MTA for all versions after Exim 4.69. Therefore, DomainKeys is
  obsoleted for all Exim4U versions after Exim4U 1.1.0.

  Exim RPMs are no longer included. Download links are provided instead and the license 
  is modified accordingly.

  Minor bug fixes and house cleaning.

  Changelog available here: http://exim4u.org/svn/exim4u_src/tags/1.2.0/CHANGELOG



1.1.0 Release Date: February 21, 2010

  Exim4U Version 1.1.0 requires Exim version 4.68 or 4.69 for complete functionality.

  DomainKeys is implemented for Exim4U Version 1.1.0.
