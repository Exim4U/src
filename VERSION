                           Exim4U Version History

                       Current Exim4U Version Is 1.2.1

Exim4U Version 1.2.1 was released on December 27, 2009.
- Bug fix for mysql setup scripts where on_spamboxreport field in the users table was
  improperly named on-spambox_report. mysql_migrate/mysql_migrate.sql and 
  mysql_setup/mysql.sql scripts were revised where the field named on-spambox_report
  was replaced with the name on_spamboxreport in the users table.

Exim4U Version 1.2.0 was released on December 21, 2009.
- Exim4U Version 1.2.0 requires Exim version 4.71 or higher for complete functionality.
- DKIM was implemented. DKIM signing of outgoing mail and DKIM verification of
  imcoming mail was implemented with or without greylisting and/or failure rejection
  during the SMTP session.
- Note that Exim 4.7x's implementation of DKIM causes the obsolescence of DomainKeys
  with the Exim MTA for all versions after Exim 4.69. Therefore, DomainKeys is
  obsoleted for all Exim4U versions after Exim4U 1.1.0.
- Exim RPMs are no longer included. Download links are provided instead and the license 
  is modified accordingly.
- Minor bug fixes and house cleaning.
