                           Exim4U Version History

                       Current Exim4U Version Is 1.2.3


1.2.3 Release Date: April 6, 2010

  Critical Security Release:

    Version 1.2.3 is a critical security release. As such, all Exim4U installations
    should immediately be upgraded to version 1.2.3.  This release fixes several php
    vulnerabilities which compromised the overall security of all prior versions of
    Exim4U and its predecessor package, Vexim (Versions 2.2 and earlier). This
    release provides enhanced protection to your Exim4U installation against
    injection attacks and other potential security issues.

  New Documentation:

    SECURITY - Instructions for implementing additional administrative precautions
    to help protect your Exim4U installation from hostile intruders and other
    potential security issues.

  Other:

    Minor enhancements were implemented to several of the documentation files and
    the exim configuration files.

  Credits:

    The security vulnerabilities were identified by Mike Garrett who also provided
    guidance in fixing the identified issues.  Thanks Mike!



1.2.2 Release Date: February 21, 2010

  New Documentation:

    APPEARANCE - Instructions for customizing Exim4U's icons, images and appearance.
    EXIM_4.69 - Instructions for running Exim Version 4.69 instead of 4.71.
    FREEBSD, DEBIAN and REDHAT-CENTOS - OS specific installation notes.

  Exim Configuration Changes:

    Bug fixed in the acl_smtp_data ACL in exim.conf related to running exim
    with clamd disabled.

    Minor enhancement to SpamAssassin header rewriting in exim.conf.

    Moved several parameter settings from exim.conf to exim4u_local.conf.inc:
        exim_user
        exim_group
        av_scanner
        spamd_address

    Added default setting for mailman domain list in exim4u_local.conf.inc:
        domainlist mm_domains = :

    The variable, SENDER_RL, was added to exim4u_local.conf.inc which toggles
    sender ratelimiting ON/OFF in etc/exim/exim4u_acl_check_dkim.conf.inc.
    SENDER_RL = YES (on) /NO (off).

  Shell Scripts:

    Minor modifications were made to the following scripts:
	eximstats.sh
	spamdel
	spamreport
    The mailx/nail commands from the Heirloom project were also added to these
    scripts for mailing the reports.

    The spam deletion utility, spamdel, was completely rewritten to produce an
    improved report appearance and to be more easily configured for any mailstore
    locations (mailroot directories).

  Other:

    The HTML menu scripts in the following directories were modified to support site
    specific appearance modifications (logos, images, etc.):
        home/exim4u/public_html/admin_menu
        home/exim4u/public_html/user_menu

    The Exim4U Email Admin PHP scripts were modified in the following directories to
    support site specific appearance modifications (header text, logos, images, etc.):
        home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config
        home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/images

    All Exim4U logos were modified for improved appearance. The Exim4U admin icon was
    replaced with a new check mark icon along with another icon which is a "human"
    image and which may be alternatively used as the Exim4U admin icon.

    All tab characters were removed from the Exim4U Email Admin PHP code since some
    custom installations of Apache appeared not to handle tabs well.

    Other minor bug fixes, modifications and documentation improvements.



1.2.1 Release Date: February 21, 2010

  Bug fix for mysql setup scripts where on_spamboxreport field in the users table was
  improperly named on-spambox_report. mysql_migrate/mysql_migrate.sql and 
  mysql_setup/mysql.sql scripts were revised where the field named on-spambox_report
  was replaced with the name on_spamboxreport in the users table.



1.2.0 Release Date: February 21, 2010

  Exim4U Version 1.2.0 requires Exim version 4.71 or higher for complete functionality.

  DKIM was implemented. DKIM signing of outgoing mail and DKIM verification of
  imcoming mail was implemented with or without greylisting and/or failure rejection
  during the SMTP session.

  Note that Exim 4.7x's implementation of DKIM causes the obsolescence of DomainKeys
  with the Exim MTA for all versions after Exim 4.69. Therefore, DomainKeys is
  obsoleted for all Exim4U versions after Exim4U 1.1.0.

  Exim RPMs are no longer included. Download links are provided instead and the license 
  is modified accordingly.

  Minor bug fixes and house cleaning.

1.1.0 Release Date: February 21, 2010

  Exim4U Version 1.1.0 requires Exim version 4.68 or 4.69 for complete functionality.

  DomainKeys is implemented for Exim4U Version 1.1.0.
