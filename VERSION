                           Exim4U Version History

                       Current Exim4U Version Is 1.2.0

Exim4U Version 1.2.0 was released on December 21, 2009.
 - Exim4U Version 1.2.0 requires Exim version 4.71 or higher for complete functionality.
 - DKIM was implemented. DKIM signing of outgoing mail and DKIM verification of
   imcoming mail was implemented with or without greylisting and/or failure rejection
   during the SMTP session.
 - Note that Exim 4.7x's implementation of DKIM causes the obsolescence of DomainKeys
   with the Exim MTA for all versions after Exim 4.69. Therefore, DomainKeys is
   obsoleted for all Exim4U versions after Exim4U 1.1.0.
 - Exim RPMs are no longer included. Download links are provided instead and the license 
   is modified accordingly.
 - Minor bug fixes and house cleaning.
 - Changelog available here: http://exim4u.org/svn/exim4u_src/tags/1.2.0/CHANGELOG
