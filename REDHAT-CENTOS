                        Notes For RedHat and CentOS Users

Exim4U was originally developed under the CentOS version of Linux. Therefore,
Exim4U should work "right out of the box" on RedHat and CentOS systems. The
instructions included with Exim4U are written specifically for RedHat and
CentOS systems so just follow the README and INSTALL files verbatim.
