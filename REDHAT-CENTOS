                        Notes For RedHat and CentOS Users

Exim4U was originally developed under the CentOS version of Linux. Therefore,
Exim4U should work "right out of the box" on RedHat and CentOS systems. The
instructions included with Exim4U are written specifically for RedHat and
CentOS systems so just follow the README and INSTALL files verbatim.

Exim4U Webmail Groupware is a modified version of Horde Groupware Webmail. Prior
versions of Exim4U included Webmail Groupware that was based on Horde Version 3
whereas this Exim4U version (Exim4U version 2.0 and later) includes Webmail Groupware 
that is based on Horde Version 4 or higher. Horde version 4 or higher require php 5.3.0
or above, however, stock CentOS 5.x only provides php 5.1.x by default.  Therefore,
CentOS 5.x users will need to install php version 5.3.x.  CentOS 5.6 and above include
php 5.3 which is packaged as php53.  Alternatively, php 5.3.x can be obtained from 3rd
party repositories such as the EPEL repo.
