                        Notes For FreeBSD Users

These notes provide guidance for installing and running Exim4U on FreeBSD systems.
As stated elsewhere in these instructions, Exim4U was originally developed under
the RedHat/CentOS version of Linux, however, it has been installed and found to
work well on other Linux and Unix systems including Debian, Ubuntu and FreeBSD.

Proceed by following the instructions in the README, INSTALL, SPAMASSASSIN,
WEBMAIL, APPEARANCE and NOTES files, however, be aware that there are differences
in the FreeBSD file system as opposed to the RedHat/CentOS file system for which
those instructions were written. These notes will cover the most significant
differences and hopefully allow a smooth installation of Exim4u on your FreeBSD
system.

1) Installing application software from the ports collection.

All of the application software that is referenced in the README and INSTALL
file instructions is available from the FreeBSD ports collection and should
therefore be compiled and installed from there. Each software title may be
located by searching the ports collection using any of the following commands:

	make search name=<package name>    (from the /usr/ports directory)
	whereis <package name>
	locate <package-name> | grep ports

Then, when each package is found, change directory to the appropriate ports
directory and compile and install using "make install clean".

2) Exim MTA

The Exim package should be compiled with MySQL and SQLite enabled. Compile Exim
from the FreeBSD ports collection in the /usr/local/ports/mail/exim directory.
Use the "make config" command and include MySQL and SQLite by checking the MySQL
and SQLite boxes in the config menu. If this is a new installation, then compile
and install as follows:

	make install clean

If this is a re-installation, then deinstall, compile and install as follows:

	make deinstall clean
	make install clean

FreeBSD's installation of exim includes the default exim configuration in
/usr/local/etc/exim/configure, however, you should implement the Exim4U configuration
as follows:

	Create a directory in /etc named exim (/etc/exim).  Then, copy the
	etc/exim directory and all of its contents from the Exim4U distribution
	to /etc/exim on the target FreeBSD machine.  Then edit 
	/usr/local/etc/exim/configure so that it only contains the following
	line:

		.include /etc/exim/exim.conf

	FreeBSD will now execute the Exim4U exim configuration automatically.

Exim should be run under FreeBSD as the following owner and group:

	user = mailnull
	group = mail

The mysql socket location under FreeBSD is:

	/tmp/mysqld.sock

The mysql statement in exim4u_local.conf.inc should read as follows:

	hide mysql_servers = <hostname>::(/tmp/mysqld.sock)/exim4u/exim4u/<password>

The service for starting/stopping/restarting exim on FREEBSD is:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/exim

The mail store directory, such as /home/exim4u/mail (/usr/home/exim4u/mail), must be
created manually. Set the ownership and permissions to be writable by the user (exim4u).

Exim's TLS certificates must be stored in /etc/pki/tls/exim_tls as described in
etc/exim/exim4u_local.conf.inc according to whether MULTI_IP=YES or NO. You will
need to create the directory structure for /etc/pki/tls/exim_tls since these are
non-standard directories for FreeBSD.

3) Exim4U Web Interface, Apache and PHP

Apache runs under FreeBSD as apache22.  Install apache22, php, perl, pear and mysql from
the ports collection.  You should also install all of the php extensions, perl modules and
pear modules that are called for in the INSTALL, SPAMASSASSIN and WEBMAIL files. Use the
Addendum at the end of this file as a tool for locating the correct port name for the
applications, php extensions, perl modules and pear modules that you need to install. For
example, these php extensions are required for the Exim4U web interface:

	php5-gettext  (installed from /usr/ports/devel/php5-gettext)
	php5-session  (installed from /usr/ports/www/php5-session)
	php5-dom      (installed from /usr/ports/textproc/php5-dom)
	php5-posix    (installed from /usr/ports/sysutils/php5-posix)

The standard DocumentRoot for FreeBSD is typically /usr/local/www/apache22/data or
/usr/local/www/apache22/data_ssl.  Exim4U's INSTALL file instructions locate the
web interface's DocumentRoot at /home/exim4u/public_html which is standard for
RedHat/CentOS. Nevertheless, you may relocate the DocumentRoot to any other
directory that you prefer.

4) php.ini Configuration File

The php configuration file, php.ini, is located in /usr/local/etc/php.ini in FreeBSD
(or /usr/local/Zend/etc/php.ini if the Zend Optimizer is installed). Two parameters
need to be set in php.ini: short_open_tag=on and output_buffering = 4096.

Set: short_open_tag=on

short_open_tag=on must be set for the Exim4U PHP code to work properly.  However, Munin
will not run with short_open_tag=on. Therefore, create an .htaccess files in the munin
directory and the munin/<host_name> subdirectories as follows:

	php_flag short_open_tag off

Munin will then run properly with this .htaccess file installed.

Set: output_buffering = 4096

With output_buffering = Off, the following error will occur on some pages in Exim4U's
web interface such as the “Add Alias” page:

	session_start() [function.session-start]: Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already sent

To fix this, set output_buffering = 4096 in php.ini.

5) SpamAssassin

The FreeBSD SpamAssassin port also installs Razor, however, DCC and Pyzor must be
installed separately from ports.

When installing the necessary perl modules for sa-update to run without any "module
not installed" error messages you should install Mail:SPF and not Mail:SPF:Query even
though sa-update will continue issuing "module not installed" for Mail:SPF:Query.
Mail:SPF:Query is actually deprecated to Mail:SPF and FreeBSD will not allow them both
to be installed simultaneously since they use the same installation directory.  Whereas
RedHat/CentOS allows them both to be installed simultaneously. It really doesn't
matter as long as one or the other is installed since they provide the same
functionality.

Mail:SPF is named p5-Mail-SPF in FreeBSD and it is installed from ports here:

	/usr/ports/mail/p5-Mail-SPF	

Then, a crontab entry should be made to root's crontab (with crontab -e) to start
p5-Mail-SPF at startup:

	@reboot /usr/local/sbin/spfd -socket=/tmp/spfd --socket-user mailnull --socket-group mail

The Exim4U INSTALL instructions call for the SPF startup script to be put in
RedHat/CentOS's /etc/rc.local directory, however, there is no /etc/rc.local in
FreeBSD. Therefore, a crontab entry should be made to root's crontab (with
crontab -e) to start p5-Mail-SPF at startup as described above at reboot (@reboot).

6) DCC

The DCC port installs the following four services but you only need to implement
the dccifd service:

dccifd – Interface to SpamAssassin (General MTA interface). USE THIS SERVICE.
dccd –  Internal DCC server but not used if you are using a public DCC server.
dccgrey – Grey listing. Not used in Exim4U.
dccm – Milter to sendmail. Not used in Exim4U.

DCC is disabled by default in SpamAssassin because it is not considered completely
open source. Enable the DCC plugin by entering the following line in
/usr/local/etc/mail/spamassassin/v310.pre:

	loadplugin Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::DCC

7) Pyzor

Following installation, Pyzor generated the following error in FreeBSD 8.0 when
running "pyzor discover":

# pyzor discover
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pyzor/__init__.py:11: DeprecationWarning: the sha module is deprecated; use the hashlib module instead
  import sha
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pyzor/client.py:12: DeprecationWarning: the multifile module has been deprecated since Python 2.5
  import multifile

Pyzor will not run like this, however, you may solve this problem by changing
the first line of /usr/local/bin/pyzor to:

	#!/usr/local/bin/python -Wignore::DeprecationWarning

8) ClamAV

Make sure and specify the TCP socket as 3310 for clamd in clamd.conf:

	 TCPSocket 3310

Otherwise, without the TCPSocket specified, the Clamd header writing
will not specify the ClamAV version.

The socket file that exim uses for the clam daemon (clamd) is defined in
exim4u_local.conf.inc with a default setting of:

        av_scanner = clamd:/var/run/clamav/clamd

This default works with CentOS, however, on FreeBSD that line should read:

        av_scanner = clamd:/var/run/clamav/clamd.sock 

9) Webmin

Configure Webmin with:

	/usr/local/lib/webmin/setup.sh

The Webmin service is:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/webmin start

10) Resolving File System Incompatibilities Between FreeBSD and RedHat/CentOS Linux

There are numerous differences in the file systems between FreeBSD and RedHat/CentOS.
The following notes will resolve several compatibility issues with the shell
scripts that are included with Exim4U which were originally written for RedHat/CentOS.

For the bash shell scripts to work under FreeBSD use the following symbolic link:

ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash

Several commands are located in different directories in FreeBSD than CentOS. This
can also be resolved with symbolic links:

ln -s /usr/bin/mail /bin/mail
ln -s /usr/local/bin/sa-update /usr/bin/sa-update
ln -s /usr/local/bin/php /usr/bin/php    (horde cli scripts such as setup.php)
ln -s /usr/local/bin/sqlite3 /usr/bin/sqlite3 (exim greylisting cron script greylist_tidy.sh)
ln -s /usr/local/sbin/exim_tidydb /usr/sbin/exim_tidydb   (exim_tidydb script)

The INSTALL file calls for certain scripts to be installed in /etc/cron.daily in
the RedHat/CentOS file system.  However, FreeBSD does not have /etc/cron.daily.
Therefore, install those scrips in either /root/crontab or in root's crontab with
the "crontab -e" command.

11) Exim And The mail Command

On FreeBSD, following the installation of exim, the mail command invokes exim whereas
on RedHat/CentOS the mail command continues to invoke sendmail.  Sendmail supports
the -s flag for subjects whereas exim does not. To resolve this, the Exim4U scripts
were modified to use mailx/nail from the Heirloom project.  Linux uses “nail” whereas
FreeBSD uses “mailx”.  However, in FreeBSD, there is a /usr/bin/mailx that invokes
sendmail and which also conflicts. So, in FreeBSD, always invoke Heirloom mail with
/usr/local/bin/mailx.

12) Enable Services To Start At System Boot in /etc/rc.conf

Add the necessary entries to /etc/rc.conf to enable all of your services to start
automatically when the system boots up. The following are the appropriate entries
in /etc/rc.conf to start the various Exim4U related services at system boot:

apache22_enable="YES"
mysql_enable="YES"
exim_enable="YES"
sendmail_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
spamd_enable="YES"
dccifd_enable="YES"
clamav_clamd_enable="YES"
clamav_freshclam_enable="YES"
dovecot_enable="YES"
munin_node_enable="YES"
webmin_enable="YES"

13) Open The Appropriate Firewall Ports

Make sure that you have opened all of the appropriate ports on your firewall. The
following ports generally need to be opened for Exim4U to function properly:

22/tcp       ssh
25/tcp       smtp
80/tcp       http
110/tcp      pop3
113/tcp      auth
143/tcp      imap
443/tcp      https
587/tcp      smtp (clients)
10000/tcp    Webmin port
