                        Notes For FreeBSD Users

These notes provide guidance for installing and running Exim4U on FreeBSD systems.
As stated elsewhere in these instructions, Exim4U was originally developed under
the RedHat/CentOS version of Linux, however, it has been installed and found to
work well on other Linux and Unix systems including Debian, Ubuntu and FreeBSD.

Proceed by following the instructions in the README, INSTALL, SPAMASSASSIN,
WEBMAIL, APPEARANCE and NOTES files, however, be aware that there are differences
in the FreeBSD file system as opposed to the RedHat/CentOS file system for which
those instructions were written. These notes will cover the most significant
differences and hopefully allow a smooth installation of Exim4u on your FreeBSD
system.

1) Installing application software from the ports collection.

All of the application software that is referenced in the README and INSTALL
file instructions is available from the FreeBSD ports collection and should
therefore be compiled and installed from there. Each software title may be
located by searching the ports collection using any of the following commands:

	make search name=<package name>    (from the /usr/ports directory)
	whereis <package name>
	locate <package-name> | grep ports

Then, when each package is found, change directory to the appropriate ports
directory and compile and install using "make install clean".

2) EXIM

The Exim package that should be compiled and installed from the FreeBSD Ports
Collection is named "exim-mysql" and is located at /usr/ports/mail/exim-mysql.
This should be exim version 4.71 (or higher) and includes MySQL, however, you
also need to include SQLite. To do this, modify the Makefile
(/usr/ports/mail/exim-mysql/Makefile) to include this line:

	WITH_SQLITE = YES

Therefore, the /usr/ports/mail/exim-mysql/Makefile should read as follows:

	# New ports collection makefile for:	exim-mysql 
	# Date created:				11 Jun 2001 
	# Whom:					Sheldon Hearn <sheldonh@FreeBSD.org> 
	# 
	# $FreeBSD: ports/mail/exim-mysql/Makefile,v 1.3 2001/06/14 21:37:17 sheldonh Exp $ 
	# 
	PKGNAMESUFFIX=	-mysql 
	MASTERDIR=	${.CURDIR}/../exim 
	WITH_MYSQL=	yes 
	#
	# Also include sqlite3
	WITH_SQLITE=	yes
	#
	.include "${MASTERDIR}/Makefile"

If this is a new installation, then compile and install as follows:

	make install clean

If this is a reinstallation, then deinstall, compile and install as follows:

	make deinstall clean
	make install clean

FreeBSD's installation of exim includes the default exim configuration, however, you
can implement a custom configuration by editing /usr/local/etc/exim/configure as
follows:

	Create a directory in /etc named exim (/etc/exim).  Then, copy the
	etc/exim directory and all of its contents from the Exim4U distribution
	to /etc/exim on the target FreeBSD machine.  Then edit 
	/usr/local/etc/exim/configure so that it only contains the following
	line:

		.include /etc/exim/exim.conf

	FreeBSD will now execute the Exim4U exim configuration automatically.

Exim should be run under FreeBSD as the following owner and group:

	user = mailnull
	group = mail

The mysql socket location under FreeBSD is:

	/tmp/mysqld.sock

The mysql statement in exim4u_local.conf.inc should then be as follows:

	hide mysql_servers = <hostname>::(/tmp/mysqld.sock)/exim4u/exim4u/<password>

Exim on FreeBSD runs as "exim". Therefore the service for starting/stopping/restarting
exim is:

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/exim

2) EXIM4U WEB INTERFACE, APACHE AND PHP

Apache runs under FreeBSD as apachea22.  Install apache22, php, perl and mysql from
the ports collection.
You also need to install the db.php pear module which is referred to as php-pear-db in the INSTALL
file:

	pear install db

To list pear installs:

	pear list

The standard DocumentRoot for FreeBSD is typically /usr/local/www/apache22/data or
/usr/local/www/apache22/data_ssl.  Exim4U's INSTALL file instructions locate the
web interface's DocumentRoot at /home/exim4u/public_html which is standard for
RedHat/CentOS. Nevertheless, you may relocate the DocumentRoot to any other
directory that you prefer.


PYZOR

Following installation, Pyzor generated the following error in FreeBSD 8.0 when
running "pyzor discover":

# pyzor discover
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pyzor/__init__.py:11: DeprecationWarning: the sha module is deprecated; use the hashlib module instead
  import sha
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pyzor/client.py:12: DeprecationWarning: the multifile module has been deprecated since Python 2.5
  import multifile

Pyzor will not run like this, however, you may solve this problem by changing
the first line of /usr/local/bin/pyzor to:

	#!/usr/local/bin/python -Wignore::DeprecationWarning
