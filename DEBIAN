                        Notes For Debian Users

These notes provide guidance for installing and running Exim4U on Debian and
Ubuntu systems. As stated elsewhere in these instructions, Exim4U was originally
developed under the RedHat/CentOS version of Linux, however, it has been installed
and found to work well on other Linux and Unix systems including Debian, Ubuntu and
FreeBSD.

Proceed by following the instructions in the README, INSTALL, SPAMASSASSIN, WEBMAIL,
APPEARANCE, and NOTES files, however, be aware that there are subtle differences in
the Debian/Ubuntu file system as opposed to the RedHat/CentOS file system for which
those instructions were written.  These notes will cover the most significant
differences and hopefully allow a smooth installation of Exim4u on your
Debian/Ubuntu system.

1) EXIM (exim4)

The Exim package in the Debian/Ubuntu repository is named "exim4".

To install Exim from the Debian/Ubuntu repository:

sudo apt-get install exim4-base
sudo apt-get install exim4-daemon-heavy

These commands should setup and install the following packages:

	exim4-config
	exim4-base
	exim4-daemon-heavy
	exim4

The version of Exim in the Debian/Ubuntu repositories as of this writing was 4.69
whereas Exim4U version 1.2.x requires Exim version 4.71 for complete functionality.
However, the only functionality that is lost with Exim 4.69 is DKIM signing and
verification. See the file, EXIM_4.69, which includes instructions for modifying
Exim4U version 1.2.x to run with Exim version 4.69. Alternatively, you may use
Exim 4.71 from debian backports if you want DKIM signing and verification features
(read exim backport below)

The Debian distribution has its own exim configuration system, however, you can
implement a custom configuration in /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.  Therefore, follow the
following procedure for enabling the Exim4U exim configuration under Debian/Ubuntu:

	Copy the etc/exim directory and all of its contents from the Exim4U
	distribution to /etc/exim on the target Debian machine.  Then symbolically
	link /etc/exim/exim.conf to /etc/exim4/exim4.conf:

		ln -s /etc/exim/exim.conf /etc/exim4/exim4.conf

	Additionally, you may want to set dc_eximconfig_configtype=none in
        /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf to stop debconf from asking you questions
	about Debian's exim4 configuration.  Use "man update-exim4.conf" for more
	information.
	
	Debian will now execute the Exim4U exim configuration automatically.

Exim should be run under Debian/Ubuntu as the following ownership/group:

	user = Debian-exim
	group = Debian-exim

The mysql socket location under Debian/Ubuntu is:

	/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

The mysql statement in exim4u_local.conf.inc should then be as follows:

	hide mysql_servers = <hostname>::(/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock)/exim4u/Debian-exim/<password>

Exim on Debian/Ubuntu runs as "exim4". Therefore the service for starting/stopping/restarting
exim is:

	/etc/init.d/exim4

2) EXIM4U WEB INTERFACE

Apache runs under Debian/Ubuntu as apache2.  Install apache2, php5, php-pear, perl and mysql with apt.
You also need to install the db.php pear module which is referred to as php-pear-db in the INSTALL
file:

	pear install db

To list pear installs:

	pear list

The standard DocumentRoot for Debian/Ubuntu is typically /var/www or /home/www. Exim4U's INSTALL file
instructions locate the web interface's DocumentRoot at /home/exim4u/public_html which is standard
for RedHat/CentOS. Nevertheless, you may relocate the DocumentRoot to any other directory that you
prefer.

3) SPAMASSASSIN

The file SPAMASSASSIN recommends to setup a set of channels to maximize SPAM protection, here are
working instructions to pull perl packages required by these channels, note that some have no Debian
package and must be fetched from CPAN:

	apt-get install spamassassin razor libmail-dkim-perl libio-socket-ssl-perl g++
	perl -MCPAN -e'CPAN::Shell->install("Mail::DomainKeys")'
        perl -MCPAN -e'CPAN::Shell->install("IP::Country::Fast")'
        perl -MCPAN -e'CPAN::Shell->install("Net::Ident")'
        perl -MCPAN -e'CPAN::Shell->install("Encode::Detect")'
        perl -MCPAN -e "CPAN::Shell->force(qw(install Mail::SPF::Query));"

Thanks to the Debian razor package, you may start the razor setup procedure at the step where you
create the config file (read file SPAMASSASSIN for razor setup).

Force install is required for package Mail::SPF::Query to ignore unrelevant test failure on error
message comparison.

g++ is required to compile Encode::Detect.

Check that spamassassin daemon is enabled

        $ grep ENABLE /etc/default/spamassassin
        ENABLED=1

4) EXIM FROM DEBIAN BACKPORT

If you want to use Exim4U's DKIM feature and the Debian stable exim version is 4.69 then you need
the backported exim version 4.71 or higher. Ensure you have a reference to the backport repository:

        $ grep backport /etc/apt/sources.list
        # http://www.backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=instructions
        deb http://www.backports.org/debian lenny-backports main contrib non-free

Specify the packages you want to be pulled from backport

        $ cat  /etc/apt/preferences
        Package: exim4-daemon-heavy
        Pin: release a=lenny-backports
        Pin-Priority: 999

        Package: exim4-config
        Pin: release a=lenny-backports
        Pin-Priority: 999

        Package: exim4-base
        Pin: release a=lenny-backports
        Pin-Priority: 999

        Package: exim4
        Pin: release a=lenny-backports
        Pin-Priority: 999

Install these packages again

        $ aptitude install exim4-daemon-heavy exim4-config exim4
        $ dpkg -l | grep exim
