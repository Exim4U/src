			Instructions For Exim 4.69 Users

Follow these instructions to enable Exim4U version 1.2.x to run under Exim 4.69.

Please note that Exim4U's DKIM signing and verification functions will not be
operational with these changes.

1) Set DKIM_ON = NO in Exim4U's local settings configuration file:

	etc/exim4u_local.conf.inc

2) Comment out each line that contains "dkim" in Exim4U's exim configuration file:

	etc/exim.conf

   Use "#" to comment out the lines as follows:

	# dkim_verify_signers = $dkim_signers
	# acl_smtp_dkim = acl_check_dkim
	# .include /etc/exim/exim4u_acl_check_dkim.conf.inc
	# dkim_domain = ${sender_address_domain}
	# dkim_selector = exim4u
	# dkim_private_key = "/etc/pki/tls/dk/rsa.private"
	# dkim_domain = ${sender_address_domain}
	# dkim_selector = exim4u
	# dkim_private_key = "/etc/pki/tls/dk/rsa.private"
