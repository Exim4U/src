       Notes About Compatibility with Varions Exim Versions


2015-03-02: Instructions for Exim4U Users regarding workarounds for
            Exim bug 1533 which impacts Exim versions 4.83 and later.

A regression was introduced in exim 4.83, 4.84 and 4.85 that caused
the headers_remove clauses in the exim configuration files to
malfunction. This regressions is documented as Exim Bug 1533 here:

	https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1533

Exim versions earlier than Exim 4.83 are not impacted by this regression.
Additionally, changes that were made to Exim versions 4.83 and later
introduced an additional requirement that all colons be replaced by
double colons in the headers_remove statements. Therefore, three
versions of exim.conf are now included with Exim4U as follows:

- exim versions prior to 4.83 should use:
  etc/exim/exim.conf-SINGLE_COLONS_IN_HEADERS_REMOVE
- exim 4.83, 4.84 and 4.85 should use:
  etc/exim/exim.conf-HEADERS_REMOVE_WITH_COLONS_COMMENTED_OUT
- exim versions after exim 4.85 should use:
  etc/exim/exim.conf-DOUBLE_COLONS_IN_HEADERS_REMOVE

exim.conf is identical to etc/exim/exim.conf-DOUBLE_COLONS_IN_HEADERS_REMOVE
and which should be used for exim versions after exim 4.85.

Note that some OS distros patch older version of Exim with bug fixes
and which may include the fixes for the headers_remove statements
thereby requiring etc/exim/exim.conf-DOUBLE_COLONS_IN_HEADERS_REMOVE
even on Exim version 4.85 and older. This is the case with Debian 8
Jessie where the Debian team has patched Exim bug 1533 in their Exim 4.84
release thereby requiring etc/exim/exim.conf-DOUBLE_COLONS_IN_HEADERS_REMOVE.


2015-05-17: Instructions for configuring exim.conf for clear-text passwords
            instead of encrypted passwords.

If using clear passwords in the crypt field (not recommended) then modify the
AUTHENTICATION CONFIGURATION at the very end of etc/exim/exim.conf to disable
encrypted passwords for exim and enable clear-text passwords. The AUTHENTICATION
CONFIGURATION is self documented on how to do this. Use the plain_login_exim4u and
fixed_login_exim4u authenticators if passwords are encrypted. Otherwise, use the
plain_login, fixed_login and fixed_cram authenticators for plain-text passwords.
The default Exim4U configuration has plain_login_exim4u and fixed_login_exim4u
enabled for encrypted passwords while the plain_login. fixed_login and fixed_cram,
which are used for clear-text passwords, have been commented out. The encryption
method is specified in the php web interface with the $cryptscheme variable in
/home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config/variables.php. 


2010-02-21: Instructions for Exim 4.69 users regarding DKIM.

Follow these instructions to enable Exim4U versions 1.2.x and above to run under Exim 4.69.

Please note that Exim4U's DKIM signing and verification functions will not be
operational with these changes.

1) Set DKIM_ON = NO in Exim4U's local settings configuration file:
	etc/exim4u_local.conf.inc

2) Comment out each line that contains "dkim" in Exim4U's exim configuration file:
	etc/exim.conf

   Use "#" to comment out the lines as described below.

	The following global parameter definitions should be commented out:
		# dkim_verify_signers = $dkim_signers
		# acl_smtp_dkim = acl_check_dkim

	The following include file containing the DKIM ACL should be commented out:
		# .include /etc/exim/exim4u_acl_check_dkim.conf.inc

	The following lines in the remote_smtp_multi_IP_DK transport should be commented out:
		# dkim_domain = ${sender_address_domain}
		# dkim_selector = exim4u
		# dkim_private_key = "/etc/pki/tls/dk/rsa.private"

	The following lines in the remote_smtp_DK transport should be commented out:
		# dkim_domain = ${sender_address_domain}
		# dkim_selector = exim4u
		# dkim_private_key = "/etc/pki/tls/dk/rsa.private"
