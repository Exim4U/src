2015-05-17: Instructions for configuring exim.conf for clear-text passwords
            instead of encrypted passwords.

If using clear passwords in the crypt field (not recommended) then modify the
AUTHENTICATION CONFIGURATION at the very end of etc/exim/exim.conf to disable
encrypted passwords for exim and enable clear-text passwords. The AUTHENTICATION
CONFIGURATION is self documented on how to do this. Use the plain_login_exim4u and
fixed_login_exim4u authenticators if passwords are encrypted. Otherwise, use the
plain_login, fixed_login and fixed_cram authenticators for plain-text passwords.
The default Exim4U configuration has plain_login_exim4u and fixed_login_exim4u
enabled for encrypted passwords while the plain_login. fixed_login and fixed_cram,
which are used for clear-text passwords, have been commented out. The encryption
method is specified in the php web interface with the $cryptscheme variable in
/home/exim4u/public_html/exim4u/config/variables.php. 


2010-02-21: Instructions for Exim 4.69 users regarding DKIM.

Follow these instructions to enable Exim4U versions 1.2.x and above to run under Exim 4.69.

Please note that Exim4U's DKIM signing and verification functions will not be
operational with these changes.

1) Set DKIM_ON = NO in Exim4U's local settings configuration file:
	etc/exim4u_local.conf.inc

2) Comment out each line that contains "dkim" in Exim4U's exim configuration file:
	etc/exim.conf

   Use "#" to comment out the lines as described below.

	The following global parameter definitions should be commented out:
		# dkim_verify_signers = $dkim_signers
		# acl_smtp_dkim = acl_check_dkim

	The following include file containing the DKIM ACL should be commented out:
		# .include /etc/exim/exim4u_acl_check_dkim.conf.inc

	The following lines in the remote_smtp_multi_IP_DK transport should be commented out:
		# dkim_domain = ${sender_address_domain}
		# dkim_selector = exim4u
		# dkim_private_key = "/etc/pki/tls/dk/rsa.private"

	The following lines in the remote_smtp_DK transport should be commented out:
		# dkim_domain = ${sender_address_domain}
		# dkim_selector = exim4u
		# dkim_private_key = "/etc/pki/tls/dk/rsa.private"
